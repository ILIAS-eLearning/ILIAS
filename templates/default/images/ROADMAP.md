# Roadmap

## Short Term

### Revise internal structure of /images directory

We would We would like to tidy up the /images folder and move the many files stored 
there into suitable subdirectories. This should make the directory clearer. And the
images files can be more easily assigned to the associated application fields.

### Get rid of duplicates

Some icons in /images exist two or more times. We will check if we really need all of 
them or if we can reduce them in some cases to one image file.

## Mid Term

### Adapting glyphs to icon language

The glyphs we currently use in ILIAS (il-icons font) should be adpated to the style and
visual language of the new Milos iconset.

## Long Term
