# Roadmap
The System Styles, most importantly, the CSS contained in the System Styles are currently
lacking a coherent structure along with guidelines. They grew too large over time to be 
handled by one single developer and would therefore highly benefit from contributions among 
different developers and even service providers. They are of modular structure with different parts 
following a similar scheme. Further, they are critical importance for many other components. Therefore, we consider
them suited perfectly to be maintained by the Coordinator Model, see: https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/blob/trunk/docs/development/maintenance-coordinator.md

This Roadmap is therefore a first step to meet the requirements listed above for such a maintenance.

## Frameworkless SASS for the UI-Framework
A proposal for better structuring the System Styles has been provided and accepted by the JF in 2021, see: https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/blob/trunk/src/UI/docu/sass-guidelines.md

Refactorings in the System Styles should therefore work towards this proposed Guidelines. A
first large iteration is planned for September and October 2022 by Cat.
