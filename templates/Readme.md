# System Styles

The templates folder of ILIAS contains the ILIAS System Styles. System Styles
are defined by the set of icons, fonts, html templates and CSS/Less files that
define the visual appearance of ILIAS. They differ from Content Styles, which
enable to manipulate the classes defining the appearance of user generated
content.

## Custom Styles

System Styles may be customized by creating custom System Styles. Custom styles have
to be placed in the `./Customizing/global/skin` directory to be active. One may have
multiple substyles which may be active for different branches of the repository.

### Tools

To generate a customized System Style, first install the necessary tools to your
server . These tools include nodejs and the mode packet manager. After that you
can install the less compiler using:

```
npm install -g less
```

or

```
apt-get install node-less
```
If you want to create system styles throught frontend, make sure, that your webserver
has the permission to read and execute your newly installed less compiler.

### How-To 1 (Through Frontend)

#### Step 1: Activate "Manage System Styles"

1. Browse to the ILIAS Setup (`your.installation.com/setup/setup.php`) and Login
Using the Master Password
2. Navigate to "Basic Settings" and activate "Manage System Styles"

#### Step 2: Create new System Style

1. Navigate to "Administration -> Layout and Styles" of you ILIAS Installation.
2. Add a new System Style and activate it.
3. Optional: Add a new Sub Style for the created System Style through the
frontend
4. Optional: Change the less variables for the new System Style through the
frontend
5. Optional: Change the Icon colors of the new System Style through the frontend
6. Optional: Manually add template files for the new System Style (see "Change
Layout" bellow)

### How-To 2 (Manually)

#### Step 1: Create skin directory

To create a new skin, first add a new subdirectory to directory
`Customizing/global/skin`, e.g. `Customizing/global/skin/myskin`.

#### Step 2: Create template.xml File

One file that must exist in every skin is the file template.xml. E.g.
`Customizing/global/skin/myskin/template.xml`:

```
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<template xmlns = "http://www.w3.org" version = "1" name = "MySkin">
        <style name = "MyStyle" id = "mystyle" image_directory = "images"/>
</template>
```

Every skin can contain multiple styles. This example defines one style called
MyStyle. This skin/style combination will be listed as MySkin/MyStyle in the
ILIAS Style and Layout administration. The ILIAS administration is the place
where you can activate/deactivate styles, and where you can assign users from
one skin to another.

#### Step 2: Create main CSS File

The `id` attribute of the style tag defines the name of the corresponding style
sheet (CSS) file. This CSS file must also be added to the skin directory (here:
`Customizing/global/skin/myskin/mystyle.css`). You should start with a copy of
the default CSS file located at `templates/default/delos.css`. The best way to
see which styles are used on a given ILIAS screen is to open the HTML source of
the screen.

If your CSS file contains references to (background) images, these images must
be present at their defined locations. If you copied the default CSS file, the
image paths will not be correct anymore. You can either copy them to your skin
directory, change the CSS definitions or provide your own image files.

#### Step 2: Alternative

To have a working directory for your skin, you can also copy the complete folder
templates/default of your ilias installation to a new folder below
`Customizing/global/skin` within that directory, edit the file `template.xml` to
have an unique Style Name and id. This is needed to identify the new skin in
ILIAS' administration. Then copy the standard `delos.css` file to "your-id.css".
Take care: the main CSS-File must reflect the id in its name (see above).

#### Step 3: Less (Optional)

Note: It is usually a good idea to use less an less variables to create Custom
Styles. A good default is given, by generating a first style through the
frontend and then add the changes manually.

If you copied delos.less compiling the standard delos.less file would fail due
to path problems. In the file delos.less at about line 20 the base for some
imports is set. Since the files were moved to the new location, this path must
be fixed to make the imports work. prepending `../../` to the path works. At
this point, compiling should run without errors, but some icons (like the search
button) can not be displayed. To fix this, edit `less/variables.less`.

To test the settings, compile the less-file:

```
lessc delos.less mystyle.css
```

or

```
lessc --clean-css delos.less mystyle.css
```

for a minified CSS version.


#### Step 4: Add Icons (Optional)

If you want to replace the default icons coming with ILIAS, you can add new
representations of them to your skin. They must be stored in a subdirectory
named like the `image_directory` attribute of the style tag in the
`template.xml` file.

E.g. if you want to replace the default icon for categories
`templates/default/images/icon_cat.sfg`, and your template file defines
`image_directory = "images"` as in the example above, the new version must be
stored as `Customizing/global/skin/myskin/images/icon_cat.svg`.

#### Step 5: Change Layout (Optional)

The layout is specified in HTML template files. Some standard default template
files can be found in directory `templates/default`. Other template files are
stored within subdirectories of the Modules or Services directories. Most ILIAS
screens use more than one template file. Some template files are reused in many
ILIAS screens (e.g. the template file that defines the layout of the main menu).

To replace a template file for your skin, you have to create a new one in your
skin directory. Please note, that your skin should only contain template files
that are modified. You do not need to copy all default template files to your
new skin. Examples:

* To replace the template for the standard screen layout defined in
`templates/default/tpl.adm_content.html`, create a new version at
`Customizing/global/skin/myskin/tpl.adm_content.html`.
* `Module/Service` related template files must be stored in a similar
subdirectory structure (omit the `templates` subdirectory). E.g. to replace the
template file `Services/MainMenu/templates/tpl.main_menu.html` create a new
version at
`Customizing/global/skin/myskin/Services/MainMenu/tpl.main_menu.html`. The
following list contains some standard template files, that are often changed in
skins.
* Main Menu: `Services/MainMenu/templates/default/tpl.main_menu.html`
* Startup Screens (Login, Registration, ...):
`Services/Init/templates/default/tpl .startup_screen.html`
* Breadcrumb: `Services/Locator/templates/default/tpl.locator.html`
* Standard Screen Layout (used on many screens): 
`templates/default/tpl.adm_content.html`

#### Step 6: Change the ILIAS Icon

The main ILIAS icon is stored in the images Directory as `HeaderIcon.svg`. You
con replace this easyly by your own Icon in svg format. As long as your Icon is
close to a square, this may be all that is needed. Probably you want to change
the file favicon `.ico` in ILIAS' root directory too. For non-square Icons you
may refer to:

[Installation and Maintenance » Change the ILIAS
icon](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto_docu_pg_68691_367.html)


#### Optional: Configuring lessc on OSX with MAMP

This exlpains how to adjust your MAMP installation to work with System Styles in Ilias on OSX.

First you have to Install Xcode Command Line Tools. Then execute:
```
xcode-select --install
Install Node.js 
cd /Applications/MAMP/
git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git
cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install
Install Less + lessc
sudo npm install -g less
```

Edit the File Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envars.
Add the line export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin" to the envars file. 
Make sure that all the other lines are commented (an # is added in front of the line).

Edit the file Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envars_std
Make sure that every line is commented. (an # is added in front of the line).

Change the rights on the files. Open a Terminal and execute:
```
chmod -R 777 /Application/MAMP/Library/bin
```

Note that this is only a good option for a local test environment in some protected enironment. Give more sensitive
Permission rights if there is possible access from the outsite.

Activate System Styles in Ilias
In a Browser go to localhost:8888/setup/setup.php and Login using the Master-Password. Under “Basic Settings” activate “Manage System Styles”.
Set the lessc Path to /usr/local/bin/lessc


### Migration

There might be changes you need to consider if updating to a new ILIAS version.

Note that this changelog was introduced for ILIAS 5.3. If migrating to a lower
version you might find helpful information by consulting:

[Installation and Maintenance » Prepare for a new
skin](https://www.ilias.de/docu/goto_docu_pg_68693_367.html)

#### ILIAS 5.3

The `icon-font-path` for glyphs has changed due to a move from the bootstrap
library to the new location for external libraries. The new location is:
`"../../../../libs/bower/bower_components/bootstrap/fonts/"`. If a 5.2 style is
imported, the variable `icon-font-path` must be adapted accordingly.

## Less Guideline

Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding
features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that
allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and expendable (see:
[less.org](http://lesscss.org/)).

Since ILIAS 5.0 Bootstrap 3 is used. With the Design Revision 5.1 the JF decided
that Bootstrap Concepts SHOULD be used where possible. One important element of
Bootstrap 3 is the usage of less.

### General

* All new CSS-Styles of Modules or Services in ILIAS MUST be written in less.
* You SHOULD consult [less.org](http://lesscss.org/) to make use of the
advantages of less.
* Delos.less MUST only contain imports and no other less logic at all.
* You MUST NOT use style attributes in HTML templates (style, align, border,
cellpadding, cellspacing font, nowrap, valign, width, height).
* HTML templates are only responsible for a well structured HTML document, which
displays the bare content of the website and nothing else.
* Less/CSS is responsible for the beauty of the website. All Colors, but also
font sizes, spaces, offsets and gaps must be defined by Less/CSS. Also, the
proportions of the basic layout.
* You MUST NOT use `&nbsp;` to create space.

### Variables

#### Naming

* All less variables MUST be stored in the `variables.less` file.
* Less variables MUST be named
`il-component-they-are-primarely-used-in-descriptive-functionality-name`.
Example: `il-modal-body-bg-color`. Note the `il-prefix`, distinguishing this
variable from a bootstrap standard variable.
* In the variables.less file, the variables MUST be structured into categories.
* Variables and Sections MUST use the following template as structure:

```
//== Name of Category (e.g. Colors)
//
//## Description of Category

//** Variable 1 Description
@variable-1-name:   variable-1-value;
//** Breadcrumb background color
@variable-2-name:   variable-2-value;
```

#### Colors

* All colors MUST be defined by using variables. In any less file other than
variables `.less`  there are therefore only color assignments by directly using
a variables allowed .  E.g. `color: darken(@other-variable, 10%)`, or `color:
#564` is not allowed outside variables less.
* In the `variables.less` file, all new color values MUST be defined in the
"Colors" section.  Later those values can be reassigned to other variables, but
the values  MUST NOT be changed anymore. E.g. `@il-modal-bg` can be defined
outside the colors section,  but should be assigned directly to a variable from
the colors section.  E.g. `il-modal-bg: @il-primary-container-bg`, and not
`il-modal-bg: darken(@il-primary-container-bg, 15%)` or similar.
* Shortforms MUST be used in less and CSS. E.g. `#efe`, instead of `#eeffee`.
* Only use lowercase for color codes in less and CSS. E.g. `#efe`, instead of
`#EFE`.
* You SHOULD use the extended color variants (see variables.less) to generate
colors for components displaying areas or labels that need to be differentiated
by colors such as charts.
* You MAY use the given less variables to generate own classes or you MAY use
the classes given in colors.less. If generating own classes you MAY use
colors.less as an example on how to use mixins in less to reduce the amount of
code needed to generate such classes in less.

#### Customize

* Note that custom variables in a custom variables.less file have the be
included after the `delos.less` file.
* Also note that in delos, the ilias custom variables are included after all the
bootstrap includes. This as to do with the way less assignes values from
variables to less content by compiling the less to CSS. See
[lessc](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-options/).

### Classes

* You SHOULD use Bootstrap classes if possible (see
[getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a documentation of all
bootstrap components, classes can be found in the code snippets).
* If new less classes are needed they MUST be named according the following
pattern: `il-component-descriptive-name`. Example: `il-modal-title` Note the
`il-` prefix distinguishing this class from a standard bootstrap class.

### Attributes

* You SHOULD aim to write as little less as possible. Use existing bootstrap
logic if possible.
* If you need to add custom styling, you SHOULD the following ordering for your
attributes (see [Concentric
CSS](http://http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/)): Concentric
CSS/Less Overview.

```
#Concentric-CSS-Overview {
        display: ;    /* Directions about where and how the box is placed */
        position: ;
        float: ;
        clear: ;

        visibility: ; /* Next: can the box be seen? */
        opacity: ;
        z-index: ;

        margin: ;     /* Layers of the box model, from outside to inside */
        outline: ;
        border: ;
        background: ; /* (padding and content BOTH get the background color) */
        padding: ;

        width: ;      /* Content dimensions and scrollbars */
        height: ;
        overflow: ;

        color: ;      /* Textual content */
        text: ;
        font: ;
}
```

### Structure

* The less variables file is place in `templates/default/less/variables.less`
* Less files for centralized UI-Components MUST be placed in
`src/UI/templates/ComponentName/ComponentName.less`
* Less files for existing UI for Modules or Services are stored in
`templates/default/less/Modules/...` (or `templates/default/less/Services/...`).

### Media

* Media queries SHOULD directly added into the less structure. `Delos_sm` files
are deprecated and MUST NOT be created anymore.
* We currently follow a desktop first approach on the less level. This means,
that we handle all mobile cases as special cases and the desktop as the default.
* You should use: `max-width: @grid-float-breakpoint-max` instead of `min-width:
@grid-float-breakpoint (or min-width: @screen-sm-min)`. With `max-width`,  the
mobile version is declared as the special case version (desktop first).
