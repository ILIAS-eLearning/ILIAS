     *   composition: >
     *     The main parts of a Page are the Metabar, the Mainbar providing
     *     main navigation, the logo, title, breadcrumbs and, of course, the pages's
     *     content. "Content" in this case is the part of the page that is
     *     not Mainbar, Metabar, Footer or Locator, but e.g. the Repository-Listing,
     *     an object's view or edit form, etc.
     *     The locator (in form of breadcrumbs), the logo and titles are optional.
     *     Finally, there are short- and view title. The short title is usually used
     *     to identify the installation of ILIAS, while the view-title gives a very
     *     short  reference to the current view. Both short title and view title are
     *     put into the title-tag of the page so they show up in the browser's tab.
