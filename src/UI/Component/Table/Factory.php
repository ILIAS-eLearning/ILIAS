	 * description:
	 *   purpose: >
	 *       The Presentation Table lists some tabular data in a pleasant way. The user
	 *       can get a quick overview over the records in the dataset, the Presentation
	 *       Table only shows the most relevant fields of the records at first glance.
	 *       The records can be expanded to show more extensive information, i.e.
	 *       additional fields and further information.
	 *
	 *       The Presentation Table represents the displayed dataset an entirety rather
	 *       than a list of single rows. The table facilitates exploring the dataset,
	 *       where the purpose of this exploration is known and supported. Single records
	 *       may be derived and composed from all kind of sources and do not necessarily
	 *       reference a persistent entity like an ilObject.
	 *
	 *   composition: >
	 *       The Presentation Table consists of a title, a slot for View Controls and
	 *       Presentation Rows. The rows will be prefixed by an Expand Glyph and consist
	 *       of a headline, a subheadline and a choice of record-fields. The expanded row
	 *       will show a lists of further fields and, optionally, a button or dropdown
	 *       for actions. The table is visually represented as a wholeness and does not
	 *       decompose into several parts.
	 *
	 *   effect: >
	 *       Rows can be expanded and collapsed to show/hide more extensive and detailed
	 *       information per record. A click on the Expand Glyph will enlarge the row
	 *       vertically to show the complete record and exchange the Expand Glyph by a
	 *       Collapse Glyph. Fields that were shown in the collapsed row will be hidden
	 *       except for headline and subheadline. The ordering among the records in the
	 *       table, the ordering of the fields in one row or the visible contents of the
	 *       table itself can be adjusted with View Controls. In contrast to the accordions
	 *       known from the page editor, it is possible to have multiple expanded rows in
	 *       the table.
	 *
	 *   rivals:
	 *     Data Table: >
	 *       A data-table shows some dataset and offers tools to explore it
	 *       in a user defined way. Instead of aiming at simplicity the Presentation
	 *       Table aims at maximum explorability. Datasets that contain long content fields,
	 *       e.g. free text or images, are hard to fit into a Data Table but can indeed
	 *       be displayed in a Presentation Table.
	 *     Listing Panel: >
	 *       Listing Panels list items, where an item is a unique entity
	 *       in the system, i.e. an identifyable, persistently stored object. This is
	 *       not necessarily the case for Presentation Tables, where records can be composed
	 *       of any data from any source in the system.
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *       1: Rows in the table MUST be of the same structure.
	 *   interaction:
	 *       1: View Controls used here MUST only affect the table itself.
	 *       2: >
	 *           Clicking the Expand Glyph MUST only expand the row. It MUST NOT trigger any
	 *           other action.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *       1: >
	 *           The expandable content, especially the contained buttons, MUST be accessible
	 *           by only using the keyboard.
