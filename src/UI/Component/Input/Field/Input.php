/**
 * This describes commonalities between all inputs.
 *
 * Inputs are different from other UI components. They bundle two things:
 * the displaying of the component (as the other components do as well)
 * and the processing of data as it is received from the client.
 *
 * There are two types of input fields, individual and groups. They share
 * this same basic input interface.
 *
 * When the term "value" is used, it references the content of the input
 * as it is shown to the client. The term "content" on the other hand means
 * the value that is contained in the input after the client sends it to the
 * server.
 *
 * The latter, i.e. the content, can be validated via constraints and transformed
 * into other types of data. This means, that e.g. the value of an input could
 * be some id, while the content could be some object referenced by that id.
