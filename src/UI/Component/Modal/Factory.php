	 *     Round-Trip modals are to be used if the context would be lost by performing this action otherwise.
	 *     Round-Trip modals accommodate sub-workflows within an overriding workflow.
	 *     The Round-Trip modal ensures that the user does not leave the trajectory of the

	 *     while working in an object.

	 *       a Round-Trip modal MUST NOT be used.
	 *     3: >
	 *       When the workflow is completed, Round-Trip modals SHOULD show the same view that
	 *       was displayed when initiating the modal.
	 *     4: >
	 *       Round-Trip modals SHOULD NOT be used to add new items of any kind since adding item is a
