	 *      A workflow step represents a single step in a sequence of steps.
	 *      The status of a step consists of two parts: its availability and its
	 *      outcome or result.
	 *      Possible variants of availability are "available", "not available"
	 *      and "not available anymore". The status "active" will be set by the workflow.
	 *      The status of a step is defined as "not started", "in progress",
	 *      "completed successfully" and "unsuccessfully completed".
	 *   composition: >
	 *     A workflow step consists of a label, a description and a marker
	 *     that indicates its availability and result.
	 *     If a step is available and carries an action, the label is rendered as shy-button.
	 *   effect: >
	 *     A Step MAY have an action; when clicked, the action is triggered.
	 *
	 * context:
     *     - A Step MUST be used within a Workflow.
