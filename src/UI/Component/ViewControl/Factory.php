     *      Pagination is a collection of shy-buttons to access distinct chunks
     *      of data, framed by next/back glyphs.
     *      When used with the "DropdownAt" option, a dropdown is rendered if
     *      the number of chunks exceeds the option's value.
     *   effect: >
     *      A click on an chunk-option will change the offset of the displayed data-list,
     *      thus displaying the respective chunk of entries.
     *      The active option is rendered as an unavailable shy-button.
     *      Clicking the next/back-glyphs, the previous (respectively: the next)
     *      chunk of entries is being displayed.
     *      If a previous/next chunk is not available, the glyph is
     *      rendered unavailable.
     *      If the pagination is used with a maximum of chunk-options to be shown,
     *      both first and last options are always displayed.

     *      3: Paginations MUST be visually close to the list or table their operation will have effect upon. They MAY be placed directly above and/or below the list.
     *      4: You MUST use the default label if dealing with tables.
