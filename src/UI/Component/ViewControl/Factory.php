	 *      Mode View Controls are composed of Buttons switching between active and inactive states.
	 *   effect: >
	 *      Clicking on an inactive Button turns this button active and all other inactive. Clicking on an active button
	 *      has no effect.
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *      1: Exactly one Button MUST always be active.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *      1: The HTML container enclosing the buttons of the Mode View Control MUST cary the role-attribute "group".
	 *      2: The HTML container enclosing the buttons of the Mode View Control MUST set an aria-label describing the element. Eg. "Mode View Control"
	 *      3: The Buttons of the Mode View Control MUST set an aria-label clearly describing what the button shows if clicked. E.g. "List View", "Month View", ...
	 *      4: The currently active Button must be labeled by setting aria-checked to "true".

	 *      Section View Controls are composed of three Buttons. The Button on the left caries a Back Glyph, the Button

	 *      a next Glyph.

	 *   composition: >
	 *      Sortation uses a Dropdown to display a collection of shy-buttons.
	 *   effect: >
	 *      A click on an option will change the ordering of the associated data-list
	 *      by calling a page with a parameter according to the selected option or triggering a signal.
	 *      The label displayed in the dropdown will be set to the selected sorting.

	 *   usage:
	 *      1: A Sortation MUST NOT be used standalone.
	 *      2: Sortations MUST BE visually close to the list or table their operation will have effect upon.
	 *      3: There SHOULD NOT be more than one Sortation per view.
