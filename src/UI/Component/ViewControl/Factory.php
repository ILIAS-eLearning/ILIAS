	 *   composition: >
	 *      Mode View Controls are composed of Buttons switching between active and inactive states.
	 *   effect: >
	 *      Clicking on an inactive Button turns this button active and all other inactive. Clicking on an active button
	 *      has no effect.

	 *   usage:
	 *      1: Exactly one Button MUST always be active.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *      1: The Buttons of the Mode View Control MUST cary the role-attribute "group".
	 *      2: The Buttons of the Mode View Control MUST set an aria-label clearly describing it's functionality.
	 *      3: The currently active Button must be labeled by setting aria-checked to "true".

	 *   composition: >
	 *      Section View Controls are composed of three Buttons. The Button on the left caries a Back Glyph, the Button
	 *      in the middle is either a Default- or Split Button labeled accordingly and the Button on the right carries
