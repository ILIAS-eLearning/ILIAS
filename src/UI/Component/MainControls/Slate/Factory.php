     *     Notifications Slates are used by the system to publish information to
     *     the user in the form of Notification Items. The aim of the Notification
     *     Slates and the Notification Items they contain, is to make notifications
     *     visible and quickly accessible. They form a centralized channel which bundles notifications.
     *     Note that the Notification Slates
     *     and Items do not replace the short-lived message displayed on the screen without
     *     page loading (like "You have received 1 Contact Request") currently called "toasts".

     *     Notifications Slates hold Notification Items, displaying information
     *     on and possible interactions with the displayed notifications. They
     *     display the Notification Items chronological order (with the latest on top).
     *     Each Notification Slate bundles Notification Items of one specific
     *     type of source (service, e.g. Mail).

     *     there content to the user.

     *          Combined Slates can hold Bulky Links and other Slates, Notification
     *          Slates may only contain Notification Items. Further Combined Slates
     *          always require an icon and the contained slates are by default dis-engaged.
     *      Item Group: >
     *          Item Groups bundle any kind of Items, may hold actions on those
     *          Items and do not feature an disengaged State.

     *       (mainly in Main Bar), somewhere where old messages shown as Notification
     *       Item can still be viewed, even if they are removed from the Notification Slate.
