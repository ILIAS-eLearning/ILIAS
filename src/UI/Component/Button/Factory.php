	 *       The primary button indicates the most important action on a screen.
	 *       By definition there can only be one single “most important” action
	 *       on any given screen and thus only one single primary button per screen.

	 *       The background color is the btn-primary-color. This screen-unique
	 *       button-color ensures that it stands out and attracts the user’s
	 *       attention while there are several buttons competing for attention.
	 *   effect: >
	 *      In toolbars the primary button are required to be sticky, meaning
	 *      they stay in view in the responsive view.

	 *      Tiddwell refers to the primary button as “prominent done button” and
	 *      describes that “the button that finishes a transaction should be
	 *      placed at the end of the visual flow; and is to be made big and well
	 *      labeled.” She explains that “A well-understood, obvious last step
	 *      gives your users a sense of closure. There’s no doubt that the
	 *      transaction will be done when that button is clicked; don’t leave
	 *      them hanging, wondering whether their work took effect”.
	 *
	 *      The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines -> Buttons also describes a
	 *      button indicated as most important for dialogs.

	 * context:
	 *      - “Start test” in Module “Test”
