	 *    Standard Icons represent ILIAS Objects. In their outlined version, they are used to be layered upon a picture or
	 *    if the Standard Icon should not catch too much of the users attention.
	 *   composition: >
	 *     A Standard Icon is displayed as a block-element with a background-graphic.
	 *     By default, a fallback icon will be rendered; this is until a
	 *     background image is defined in the icon's CSS-class. The outlined version is the silhouette of the Standard Icon.
	 *     This outlined version therefore attracts less attention.
	 *   rivals:
	 *     Custom Icon: Custom Icons are constructed with a path to an (uploaded) image.
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *     1: If they are layered upon a picture, the outlined version MUST be used.
	 *     2:  >
	 *        In any other case, the non-outlined version SHOULD be used except for scenarios where the icon should
	 *        not draw too much attention.
	 *   style:
	 *     1: CSS-Filters MAY be used for Standard Icons in their outlined version to manipulate the stroke to fit the context.
	 *     2: >
	 *        In their outlined version, Standard Icons MUST only use white as color for the stroke, to make filter easily
	 *        applicable.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *     1: Icons MUST have aria-labels.

	 *       (=be quadratic) in order not to be distorted.
