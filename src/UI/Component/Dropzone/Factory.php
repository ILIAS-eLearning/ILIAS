	 *      File dropzones are used to drop files from outside the browser window.
	 *      The dropped files are presented to the user and can be uploaded to the server.
	 *      File dropzones offer additional convenience beside manually selecting files
	 *      over the file browser.
	 *   composition: >
	 *      File dropzones are areas to drop the files. They contain either a message
	 *      (standard file dropzone) or other ILIAS UI components (wrapper file dropzone).
	 *   effect: >
	 *      A dropzone is highlighted when the user drags files over it.
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   accessibility:
	 *     1: >
	 *       There MUST be alternative ways in the system to upload the files due to
	 *       the limited accessibility of file dropzones.
