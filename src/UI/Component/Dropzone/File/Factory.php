     *      Standard dropzones consist of a visible area where files can

     *      and file size.

     *      A wrapper dropzone is used to display other ILIAS UI components
     *      inside it. In contrast to the standard dropzone, the wrapper
     *      dropzone is not visible by default. Only the wrapped components are
     *      visible. Any wrapper dropzone gets highlighted once the user is dragging
     *      files over the browser window. Thus, a user needs to have the knowledge
     *      that there are wrapper dropzones present. They can be introduced to offer
     *      additional approaches to complete some workflow more conveniently.
     *      Especially in situation where space is scarce such as appointments
     *      in the calendar.
     *   composition: >
     *      A wrapper dropzone contains one or multiple ILIAS UI components.
     *      A roundtrip modal is used to present the dropped files and to initialize
     *      the upload process with a file input.
     *   effect: >
     *      All wrapper dropzones on the page are highlighted when the user
     *      dragging files over the browser window. After dropping the files, the
     *      roundtrip modal is opened showing all files. The modal contains a button
     *      to start the upload process.
