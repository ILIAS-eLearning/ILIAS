	 *      A wrapper dropzone is used to display other ILIAS UI components
	 *      inside it. In contrast to the standard dropzone, the wrapper
	 *      dropzone is not visible by default. Only the wrapped components are
	 *      visible. Any wrapper dropzone gets highlighted once the user is dragging
	 *      files over the browser window. Thus, a user needs to have the knowledge
	 *      that there are wrapper dropzones present. They can be introduced to offer
	 *      additional approaches to complete some workflow more conveniently.
	 *      Especially in situation where space is scarce such as appointments
	 *      in the calendar.
	 *   composition: >
	 *      A wrapper dropzone contains one or multiple ILIAS UI components.
	 *      A roundtrip modal is used to present the dropped files and to initialize
	 *      the upload process.
	 *   effect: >
	 *      All wrapper dropzones on the page are highlighted when the user
	 *      dragging files over the browser window. After dropping the files, the
	 *      roundtrip modal is opened showing all files. The modal contains a button
	 *      to start the upload process.
