	 *   purpose: >
	 *     Icons are quickly comprehensible and recognizable graphics that MUST be used with a text label.
	 *     They indicate the functionality or nature of the element they illustrate:
	 *     Icons will mainly be used in front of object-titles, e.g. in the
	 *     header, the tree and in repository listing.
	 *     Icons can be presented in a disabled state. Disabled Icons visually communicate that the depicted
	 *     functionality is not available for the intended audience.
	 *   composition: >
	 *     Icons come in three fixed sizes: small, medium and large.
	 *     They can be presented with an additional "abbreviation",
	 *     a text of a few characters that will be rendered on top of the image.
	 *     The Disabled Icons are visually muted: A color shade covers the Icon.
	 *   effect: >
	 *     Icons themselves are not interactive; however they are allowed
	 *     within interactive containers.
	 *   rivals:
	 *     Glyph: >
	 *       Glyphs are typographical characters that act as a trigger for
	 *       some action.
	 *     Image: >
	 *       Images belong to the content and can be purely decorative.
	 *
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *     1: Icons MUST be used to represent objects or context.
	 *     2: Icons MUST be used in combination with a title or label.
	 *     3: An unique Icon MUST always refer to the same thing.
	 *   style:
	 *     1: Icons MUST have a class indicating their usage.
	 *     2: Icons MUST be tagged with a CSS-class indicating their size.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *     1: Icons MUST bear an aria-label.
	 *     2: Disabled Icons MUST bear an aria-label indicating the disabled status.
	 *   wording:
	 *     1: The aria-label MUST state the represented object-type.
	 *     2: The abbreviation SHOULD consist of one or two letters.

	 *       Glyphs map a generally known concept or symbol to a specific concept in ILIAS.
	 *       Glyphs SHOULD NOT be used with a text label. They are used when space is scarce.
	 *   composition: >
	 *       A glyph is a typographical character. As any other typographical character, they can be
	 *       manipulated by regular CSS. If hovered, they MUST change either their color OR their background-color in order to indicate possible interactions.
	 *   effect: >
	 *       Glyphs act as a trigger for some action (such as opening a certain
	 *       Overlay type) or as a shortcut.

	 *       Icon: >
	 *           Standalone Icons are not interactive. Icons can be in an interactive container however.
	 *           Icons merely serve as an additional hint of the functionality described by a title.
	 *           Glyphs are visually distinguished from object icons: they are monochrome.
	 * background: >
	 *     "In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of
	 *     symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes
	 *     of writing and thereby expressing thoughts, ideas and concepts."
	 *     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph)
	 *
	 *     Lidwell states that such symbols are used "to improve the recognition
	 *     and recall of signs and controls".
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *       1: Glyphs MUST NOT be used in content titles.
	 *       2: >
	 *          Glyphs MUST be used for cross-sectional functionality such as Mail for
	 *          example and NOT for representing objects.
	 *       3: >
	 *          Glyphs SHOULD be used for very simple tasks that are repeated at
	 *          many places throughout the system.
	 *       4: >
	 *          Services such as Mail MAY be represented either by a glyph OR by an icon plus text label, depending on the usage scenario.
	 *   style:
	 *       1: >
	 *          All Glyphs SHOULD be taken from the Bootstrap Glyphicon Halflings
	 *          set. Exceptions are possible, but MUST be approved by the JF.
	 *   accessibility:
	 *       1: >
	 *          The functionality triggered by the Glyph MUST be indicated to
	 *          screen readers with the attributes aria-label or aria-labelledby.
