     *     Icons are quickly comprehensible and recognizable graphics.
     *     They indicate the functionality or nature of the element they illustrate:
     *     Icons will mainly be used in front of object-titles, e.g. in the
     *     header, the tree and in repository listing.
     *     Icons can be presented in a disabled state. Disabled Icons visually communicate that the depicted
     *     functionality is not available for the intended audience.
     *   composition: >
     *     Icons come in three fixed sizes: small, medium and large.
     *     The Disabled Icons are visually muted: A color shade covers the Icon.
     *   effect: >
     *     Icons themselves are not interactive; however they are allowed
     *     within interactive containers.

     *       some action.
     *     Image: >
     *       Images belong to the content and can be purely decorative.
     *
     *
     * rules:
     *   usage:
     *     1: Icons MUST be used to represent objects or context.
     *     2: Icons MUST be used in combination with a title or label.
     *     3: An unique Icon MUST always refer to the same thing.
     *   style:
     *     1: Icons MUST have a class indicating their usage.
     *     2: Icons MUST be tagged with a CSS-class indicating their size.
     *   accessibility:
     *     1: Icons MUST bear an alt-text.
     *     2: Disabled Icons MUST bear an aria-label indicating the disabled status.
     *   wording:
     *     1: The alt-text MUST state the represented object-type.

     *       A glyph is a typographical character. As any other typographical character, they can be
     *       manipulated by regular CSS. If hovered, they can change either their color or their background-color in order to indicate possible interactions.

     *           Glyphs are visually distinguished from object Icons: they are monochrome.

     *     "In typography, a glyph is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of

     *          Glyphs SHOULD be used for very simple tasks that are repeated at
