     *   purpose: >
     *      The Disclose Glyph allows hiding a complete set of entries that
     *      are too long to be presented fully or would be overwhelming.
     *      The Disclosure Glyphs offers viewing the entirety of the hidden set of entries.
     *   composition: >
     *      The Disclosure Glyph uses the glyphicon-option-vertical.
     *   effect: >
     *       Clicking the Disclose Glyph shows the entire set of entries.
     *   rivals:
     *      More Glyph: >
     *         The More Glyph hides part of the set of entries.
     *         This is a difference to the Disclose Glyph, because here the
     *         complete set of entries is collected in a glyph.
     *      Mini Action Dropdown: >
     *         The Dropdown in the ListGUI without text is used to offer a
     *         set of actions that cannot be displayed directly due to scarce space.
     *         This is different because the set of entries of the More Glyph does not entail actions.
     *      Show More Less Button: >
     *         The Show-More /Show Less Button in Timeline unhides
     *         a full individual entry of a timeline. Entries are caped at a certain
     *         length and Show-More-Buttons allow viewing all the content of this entry.
     *         This is different, because the unhidden entirety is an individual entry
     *         and not a set of entries. The Show-More /Show Less Button in filtered Categories with loads of
     *         objects shows the next x objects in the list GUI. This is different,
     *         because what is shown is not an entirety but a part of an entirety.
     *      The Hamburg Glyph: >
     *         The Hamburg Glyph is an icon introduced on the web,
     *         which in most cases represents a complete main menu. This is different
     *         from More Glyph, which abbreviates part of the menu. The hamburger
     *         icon currently used in the shortened toolbar (on small screens) should
     *         actually be replaced because it doesn't show the entire main menu, but
     *         more actions are displayed when you click on it.
     *
     * context:
     *    - This Glyph is currently used in the responsive view of the Meta Bar.

     *   usage:
     *       1: >
     *          The usage of this Glyph SHOULD be avoided if possible.
     *          Invisible components reduce the affordance of a screen.
