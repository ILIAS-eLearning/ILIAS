     *     and a required value indicated by some pointer. The comparison value is represented by a second
     *     bar below the first one. Also the percentage values of main and required are shown as text.

     *     On changing screen size they decrease their size including font size in various steps.

     *     1: Standard Progress Meters MAY contain a comparison value. If there is a comparison value it MUST be a numeric value between 0 and the maximum. It is represented as the second bar.
     *     2: Standard Progress Meters MAY contain a main value text.
     *     3: Standard Progress Meters MAY contain a required value text.
