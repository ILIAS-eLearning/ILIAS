 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a ILIAS-Logo. The logo's size changes accordingly to the size of the browser window/desktop. A title and
 *    some entries (Entry 1, Some text etc.) are displayed below the logo. The upper part of the Icons are darkened. In the
 *    left top corner you can see the outlined icon "Course".
 *    Additionally a dropdown menu is displayed in the right top corner. The menu can be opened by a click and displays links
 *    titled "Go to Course", "Go to Portfolio" and "ilias.de". Only the last link functions.
