 *   ILIAS shows a blue box titled "Drag and drop files onto me!". If you drag a file into the box a small window opens
 *   including three buttons named "Save","Close" and "Clear files!". Clicking the clear button will remove the file.
 *   The file will be shown too. You can remove a uploaded file by clicking onto the "X" on the right side.
