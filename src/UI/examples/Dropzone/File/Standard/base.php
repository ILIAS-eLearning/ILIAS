 *   Example for rendering a file dropzone.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a white box with a dashed border. You can see a text "Upload files" (displayed as a link) on the left
 *   side and on the right side the text "Drag files in here to upload them". Clicking onto the link or dragging a file
 *   into the box opens a small window with the buttons "Save" and "Cancel". If you dragged a file into the box you can
 *   see the file in said small window too. You can upload any amount of files. The window will be closed if you click
 *   onto the "Save" button. An upload doesn't happen in this example. If a file got listed after saving your selection
 *   you can remove the file by clicking the "X" on the right side.
