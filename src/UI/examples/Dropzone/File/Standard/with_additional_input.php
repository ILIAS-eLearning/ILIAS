 * ---
 * description: >
 *   Example for rendering a standard file dropzone with additional input.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a white box with a dashed border. You can see a text "Upload files" (displayed as a link) on the left
 *   side and on the right side the text "Drag files in here to upload them". Clicking onto the link or dragging a file
 *   into the box opens a small window with the buttons "Save" and "Cancel". If you dragged a file into the box you can
 *   see the file in said small window too including a text input under the file. The text input is labeled "Additional
 *   Input". Below said input "Additional input which affects all files of this upload" is written. You can upload any
 *   amount of files. The window will be closed if you click onto the "Save" button. An upload doesn't happen in this
 *   example. If a file got listed after saving your selection you can remove the file by clicking the "X" on the right
 *   side.
