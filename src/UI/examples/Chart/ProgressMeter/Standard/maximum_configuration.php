 *   Example for rendering a standard Progress Meter with maximum configuration
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rounded progress meter with two bars. The outer bar is colored red and takes up three quarter of the
 *   progress meter. The inner bar is colored grey and takes up half of the progress meter. A triangle marks the needed value
 *   at "80%". The informations "Your Score 75%" and "80% Required Score" are positioned within the progress meter.
 *
 *   Changing the size of the browser window will change the size of the progress meter: it gets smaller or bigger.
