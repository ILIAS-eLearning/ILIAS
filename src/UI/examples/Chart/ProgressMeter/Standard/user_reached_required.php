 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rounded progress meter with a green colored bar. The bar takes up 80% of the progress meter. A triangle
 *   marks the needed value at 75%. The Informations "80%" and "75%" are positioned within the progress meter.
 *
 *   Changing the size of the browser window will change the size of the progress meter: it gets smaller or bigger.
