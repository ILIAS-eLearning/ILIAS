 *   Example for rendering a fixed size Progress Meter with maximum configuration
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rounded progress meter with two bars. The outer bar is colored red and takes up three quarter of the
 *   display. The inner bar is colored grey and takes up the half of the display. A triangle marks the needed value at
 *   80%. The informations "Your Score 75%" and "80% Required Score" are positioned within the progress meter.
 *
 *   Changing the browser window's size will not change the size of the progress meter: the display stays the same!
