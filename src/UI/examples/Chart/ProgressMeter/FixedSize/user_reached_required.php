 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rounded progress meter with a green colored bar. The bar takes up 80% of the display. A triangle
 *   marks the needed value at 75%. The informations "80%" and "75%" are positioned within the progress meter.
 *
 *   Changing the browser window's size will not change the size of the progress meter: the display stays the same!
