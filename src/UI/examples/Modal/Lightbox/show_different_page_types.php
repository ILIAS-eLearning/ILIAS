 *   Example for rendering a lightbox modal.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a button titled "Show some fancy images and texts".
 *   A click onto the button will grey out ILIAS and opens a modal including multiple contents which can be displayed by
 *   clicking the arrow glyphs.
 *   All contents have got their own title.
 *   The contents consist of images and texts.
 *   In the lower part of the modal a circle glyph is displayed centered about which you can see that you can look at
 *   five contents within the modal.
 *   You can close the modal by hitting the ESC key, clicking outside of the modal onto the greyed out ILIAS in the background
 *   or clicking the "X" glyph. *
