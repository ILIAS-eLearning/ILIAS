 *   Example for rendering a lightbox text page modal with multiple texts.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a button titled "Show texts".
 *   A click onto the button greys out ILIAS and opens a modal with multiple contents which can be viewed each after another
 *   by clicking the arrow glyphs.
 *   All contents consist of a title each.
 *   In the lower part of the modal a circle glyph is centered about which you can see that you can look at two contents
 *   within the modal.
 *   You can leave the modal by hitting the ESC key or by clicking the greyed out ILIAS in the background outside of the
 *   modal or by clicking the "X".
