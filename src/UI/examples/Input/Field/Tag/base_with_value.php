 *   Example show how to create and render a basic tag input field and attach it to a
 *   form. This example does not contain any data processing.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows an input field titled "Basic TagInput". The Tag "Interesting" is already displayed and can get removed
 *   through clicking the "X". A completion of the tags will be displayed by ILIAS if an A, B, I or R is typed into the field.
 *   It is also possible to insert tags of your own and confirm those through hitting the Enter button on your keyboard.
 *   Afterwards the tags will be highlighted with color. An "X" is displayed directly next to each tag. Clicking the "X"
 *   will remove the tag.
 *   Clicking "Save" will reload the page and will set the Tag in the input field back to "Interesting".
