 *   ILIAS shows an input field titled "Basic Tag". If typing an A, B, I or R into the field ILIAS will display a
 *   completion of the possible Tags. It is also possible to insert Tags of your own and confirm those through hitting the
 *   Enter button on your keyboard. Tags which are inserted and confirmed will be highlighted with a color. A "X" is positioned
 *   directly next to each tag. You can remove the Tag through clicking the "X".
