 *   ILIAS shows a groupd titled "Take your picks" with checkboxes. You can activate one or more checkboxes. After saving
 *   your selection ILIAS will display your selection in following format:
 *
 *   Array
 *   (
 *      [multi] => Array
 *      (
 *          [0] => 2
 *          [1] => 3
 *      )
 *   )
 *
 *   If you click "Save" without selecting a checkbox ILIAS will display a error message below the group.
