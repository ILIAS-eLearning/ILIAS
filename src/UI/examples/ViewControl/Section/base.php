 *   Example performing a page reload if switching between sections of some data.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows three controls next to each other: A "Back" glyph, a label "Engaged Section" and a "Next" glyph.
 *   Clicking "Engaged Section" will reload the website. Clicking the other two controls will result to the button in the
 *   middle being disenganged and showing the label "Go to Engaged Section (Current Section: 1)". The counter increases with
 *   each click onto the "Next" glyph and decreases with each click onto the "Back" glyph. Clicking the button in the middle
 *   with the "Goto..." label will revert the buttons to the original status.
