 *   Example for rendering a standard popover with different positions.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   In this example ILIAS shows depending on the screen size and scroll position the popover's text accordingly.
 *   ILIAS shows three different buttons:
 *   - Auto Popover
 *   - Vertical Popover
 *   - Horizontal Popover
 *   Click onto the button and check if the popover's behaviour aligns with the description in the first sentence of this example's
 *   expected output.
 *   Please do some tests with different size and scroll positions on your browser window to see if the functions still work.
