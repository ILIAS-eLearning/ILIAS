 *   Example for rendering the YouTube video player
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows the rendered YouTube video player. On the left side you will see a Start/Stop
 *   symbol, followed by a time bar and on the right side a symbol for volume control and for the the full screen.
 *   A big start symbol is shown in the middle of the start screen. At the top left you will see an avatar, the video title
 *   and on the left side a symbol for sharing the video. If the video is stopped a box with the title "More Videos" and a list
 *   of videos appears in the bottommost section. The box will disappear if the video is started again.
 *
 *   In addition following functions have to be tested:
 *   - The video starts playing if clicking the start/stop symbol in the middle of the image. The video stops after another click.
 *   - The sound fades or raises if the volumes gets changed through the volume control.
 *   - Clicking the full screen icon maximizes the video player to the size of the desktop size. Clicking ESC will diminish the video player.
