 * description: >
 *  Example for rendering a mp4 video player.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rendered video player with a start screen. On the left side you will see a Start/Stop symbol,
 *   followed by a time bar and on the right side a symbol for subtitles (CC), volume control and for the the full screen.
 *   A big start symbol is shown in the middle of the start screen. While hovering over the subtitles symbol a list of all
 *   available languages appears. If a language gets selected you can find the text at the bottom of the full screen.
 *
 *   In addition following functions have to be tested:
 *   - The video starts playing if clicking the start/stop symbol in the middle of the image. The video stops after another click.
 *   - The sound fades or raises if the volumes gets changed through the volume control.
 *   - Clicking the full screen icon maximizes the video player to the size of the desktop size. Clicking ESC will diminish the video player.
