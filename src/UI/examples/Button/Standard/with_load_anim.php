 * description: >
 *   In this example we create a button that ships with the on load animation on click.
 *
 * note: >
 *   Note that the button will trigger a page-reload as soon as the work is done,
 *   no additional magic is needed.
 *   However, in Async scenario, one can make use of the il.UI.button interface
 *   containing the functions activateLoadingAnimation and deactivateLoadingAnimation
 *   as shown below.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows an active button titled "Do Something". The color of the button will change after clicking the button
 *   and the word "Working" will appear, which is referencing to the loading status. After a while the button's content
 *   will change to "Done".
