 *   ILIAS shows a switch. Clicking onto the switch will result to the switch moving to the right side and opening a
 *   dialog: "Toggle Button has been turned on".
 *   Closing the dialog via "delete" will move back the switch. The switch will stay on the right side if the dialog
 *   is closed via "close".
 *   Another click onto the switch will move the switch to the left side. ILIAS notifies: "Toggle Button has been turned off".
