 *   Example for rendering a Tag Button.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows four different buttons titled "simple tag" in following order:
 *   1. Five buttons in shaded colors. The cursor will change while hovering above the button which confirms that the
 *      buttons are clickable.
 *   2. with unavailable action: five grey buttons which are not clickable. A click won't activate any actions.
 *   3. with additional class(es): a very broad button with a loading animation at the right side.
 *   4. with fix colors: three buttons with different background colors and different text colors. Hovering over the
 *      buttons will change the cursor which confirms that the buttons are clickable.
