Scope Layout
============
The GlobalScreen service takes care of the mediation between the command classes and UI components and is responsible for assembling all necessary elements into a complete `Page` and submitting it to rendering. 

> Currently (ILIAS 6.0), the services and modules deliver their content via an `ilGlobalPageTemplate`, an implementation of the `ilGlobalTemplateInterface`. This is done for compatibility reasons. Internally, this instance delegates all relevant elements to the scope layout of the GlobalScreen service.

The Scope `Layout` assumes by default that a completely filled `page` is displayed. This `page` is filled with UI components, which in turn are filled with information from the other areas (e.g. `MetaBar` or `MainBar`). Now not all places in ILIAS need the same `Page` or all elements of a `Page` anymore.  For this purpose, a developer can influence the composition of the page from his code before passing it to rendering.

He can do this for the whole page (e.g. without the `MainBar`) or he can provide a completely custom `MainBar` if required (e.g. LTI).

All possibilities to change the components of a `page` can be found via the GlobalScreen service in the `DIC`:

```php
global $DIC;
$DIC->globalScreen()->layout()->factory()->...
```

Currently the following areas can be addressed:
- Page
- MetaBar
- MainBar
- BreadCrumbs
- Icon
- Content

## Register modification 
Like all other scopes, this scope works in the provider/collector procedure. In order to be able to make a change to the page, you implement your own `ModificationProvider`. These providers are `ScreenContextAwareProviders`, further information can be found at [src/GlobalScreen/ScreenContext/README.md](../../ScreenContext/README.md)

```php
<?php namespace ILIAS\Container\Screen;

//...

class MemberViewLayoutProvider extends AbstractModificationProvider implements ModificationProvider
{

    public function isInterestedInContexts() : ContextCollection
    {
        return $this->context_collection->repository();
    }

    public function getLogoModification(CalledContexts $screen_context_stack) : ?LogoModification
    {
        if (!$screen_context_stack->current()->hasReferenceId()) {
            return null;
        }

        $mv = ilMemberViewSettings::getInstance();
        if ($mv->isActive()) {
            return $this->globalScreen()->layout()->factory()->logo()->withModification(function (Image $current) use ($mv) : Image {
                $ref_id = $mv->getCurrentRefId();

                $image = $this->dic->ui()->factory()->image()->responsive("https://www.colourbox.com/preview/5559052-icon-user-red.jpg", "mv");
                if ($ref_id) {
                    $url = ilLink::_getLink(
                        $ref_id,
                        ilObject::_lookupType(ilObject::_lookupObjId($ref_id)),
                        array('mv' => 0)
                    );
                    $image = $image->withAction($url);
                }

                return $image;
            })->withHighPriority();
        }

        return null;
    }
}

```

The example returns - if in the `ScreenContext` 'repository', if a Ref-ID is present and if the MemberView is used in a course, â€“ a change to the logo (which is only offered as an example until a dedicated message for it is offered in the UI service).

Since multiple `ModificationProviders` could modify the same area of the page at the same time, a priority is set for each modification (in this case `->withHighPriority()`). Same priorities lead to an exception and it must be decided in JourFixe which of the two modifications gets the higher priority. 



#Attention

The possibility of influencing the components of the "page" holds dangers:
- You can never be sure that you will not make any changes before or after the change.
- Do not use this option to bring menu items or `Tools` into the `MainBar`. Use the methods provided for this purpose as `Providers` in the respective scopes.
