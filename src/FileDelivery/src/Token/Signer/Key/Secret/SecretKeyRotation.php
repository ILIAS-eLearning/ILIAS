/**
 * Key rotation can provide an extra layer of mitigation against an attacker discovering a secret key. A rotation system
 * will keep a list of valid keys, generating a new key and removing the oldest key periodically. If it takes four weeks
 * for an attacker to crack a key, but the key is rotated out after three weeks, they will not be able to use any keys
 * they crack. However, if a user doesnâ€™t refresh their token within three weeks it will be invalid too.
 *
 * The system that generates and maintains this list is outside the scope of ItsDangerous, but ItsDangerous does support
 * validating against a list of keys.
 *
 * Instead of passing a single key, you can pass a list of keys, oldest to newest. When signing the last (newest) key
 * will be used, and when validating each key will be tried from newest to oldest before raising a validation error.
