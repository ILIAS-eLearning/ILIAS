# Roadmap


## Short Term

### Store File-Structures in the IRSS
Currently, the IRSS can store and manage individual files, and offers versioning and various other features. In the future, the IRSS will also be able to manage resources in the form of file structures. This feature is needed in particular to transfer modules such as the HTML learning module or SCORM module into the IRSS.

It is currently being examined whether these file structures should also be stored in the file system as structures by the IRSS, or whether a container in the form of a Zip archive can be used. Both options have advantages and disadvantages. Basically, the implementation is to be developed together with a corresponding consumer in the form of a "player".


## Mid Term

Currently no mid-term goals are planned.


## Long Term

Currently no long-term goals are planned.
