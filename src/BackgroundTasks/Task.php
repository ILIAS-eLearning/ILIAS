 *          A Task is the basic interface of an "thing" which can be put into a Bucket and will be
 *          run or triggered by the BackgroundTask-Worker. Currently there are two types of Tasks:
 *          - Job: A Task, which can be run without any interaction with the user such as zipping
 *          files or just collecting some data
 *          - UserInteraction: A Task in the Bucket, which will need some User-Interaction before
 *          running the task. A User-Interaction is provided as Button in the UserInterface such as
 *          [ Cancel ] or [ Download ]
