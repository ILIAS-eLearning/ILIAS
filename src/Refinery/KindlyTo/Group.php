/**
 * Transformations in this group transform data to primitive types to establish

 * and thus will be useful when communicating with other systems. Look into the
 * single transformations for more information about the exact behaviour.
 *
 * They don't try to mimic PHPs type cast, but instead follow more sophisticated
 * rules devised in a series of workshops with interested developers from the
 * community. Thanks Michael Jansen, Fabian Schmid, Alex Killing, Stephan Winiker,

     * that the Refinery tries to produce one. A transformation to string is a
     * lossy transformation most of the time anyway, if we don't talk about e.g.
     * serialization formats. So we don't loose much if we, e.g., transform an
     * array to "Array".
