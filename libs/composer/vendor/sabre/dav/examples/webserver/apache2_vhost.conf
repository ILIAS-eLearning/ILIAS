# This is a sample configuration to setup a dedicated Apache vhost for WebDAV.
#
# The main thing that should be configured is the servername, and the path to
# your SabreDAV installation (DocumentRoot).
#
# This configuration assumed mod_php5 is used, as it sets a few default php
# settings as well.
<VirtualHost *:*>

    # Don't forget to change the server name
    # ServerName dav.example.org

    # The DocumentRoot is also required
    # DocumentRoot /home/sabredav/

    RewriteEngine On
    # This makes every request go to server.php
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /server.php [L]

    # Output buffering needs to be off, to prevent high memory usage
    php_flag output_buffering off

    # This is also to prevent high memory usage
    php_flag always_populate_raw_post_data off

    # SabreDAV is not compatible with mbstring function overloading
    php_flag mbstring.func_overload off
