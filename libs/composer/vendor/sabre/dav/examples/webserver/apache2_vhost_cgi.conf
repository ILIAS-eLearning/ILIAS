# This is a sample configuration to setup a dedicated Apache vhost for WebDAV.
#
# The main thing that should be configured is the servername, and the path to
# your SabreDAV installation (DocumentRoot).
#
# This configuration assumes CGI or FastCGI is used.
<VirtualHost *:*>

    # Don't forget to change the server name
    # ServerName dav.example.org

    # The DocumentRoot is also required
    # DocumentRoot /home/sabredav/

    # This makes every request go to server.php. This also makes sure
    # the Authentication information is available. If your server script is
    # not called server.php, be sure to change it.
