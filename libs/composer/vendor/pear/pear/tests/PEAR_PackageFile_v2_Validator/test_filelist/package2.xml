 <notes>Installer Roles/Tasks:

 * package.xml 2.0 uses a command pattern, allowing extensibility
 * implement the replace, postinstallscript, and preinstallscript tasks

Installer Dependency Support:

 * package.xml 2.0 has continued to improve and evolve
 * Downloader/Package.php is now used to coordinate downloading.  Old code
   has not yet been deleted, as error handling is crappy right now.  Uninstall
   ordering is broken, and needs to be redone.
 * Pre-download dependency resolution works, mostly.
 * There is no way to disable dependency resolution at the moment, this will be done.
 * Dependency2.php is used by the new PEAR_Downloader_Channel to resolve dependencies
   and include downloaded files in the calculations.
 * DependencyDB.php is used to resolve complex dependencies between installed packages
   and any dependencies installed later (a conflicts/not dependency cannot be honored
   without this DB)

Installer Channel Support:

 * channel XSD is available on pearweb
 * add channel.listAll and channel.update to default PEAR protocols
 * add ability to &quot;pear channel-update channelname&quot; to
   retrieve updates manually for individual channels
 * fix channel.xml generation to use a valid schema declaration

Installer:

 * with --remoteconfig option, it is possible to remotely install and uninstall packages
   to an FTP server.  It works by mirroring a local installation, and requires a
   special, separate local install.
 * Channels implemented
 * Bug #1242: array-to-string conversion
 * fix Bug #2189 upgrade-all stops if dependancy fails
 * fix Bug #1637 The use of interface causes warnings when packaging with PEAR
 * fix Bug #1420 Parser bug for T_DOUBLE_COLON
 * fix Request #2220 pear5 build fails on dual php4/php5 system
 * Major bug in Registry - false file conflicts on data/doc/test role
   was possible (and would happen if HTML_Template_IT was installed
   and HTML_Template_Flexy installation was attempted)
