This is an extension for the SQLite Embeddable SQL Database Engine.
http://www.sqlite.org/

SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process.

SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database server.
SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and from
the database files on disk
