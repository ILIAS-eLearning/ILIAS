N2  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there such a thing as information justice? In this paper, I argue that the current state of the information economy, particularly
 as it regards information and computing technology (ICT), is unjust, conferring power disproportionately on the information-wealthy
 at great expense to the information-poor. As ICT becomes the primary method for accessing and manipulating information, it
 ought to be treated as a foundational layer of the information economy. I argue that by maximizing the liberties (freedom
 to use, freedom to distribute, freedom to modify, and so on) associated with certain computer software, an incentives-rich
 and stable environment can be established in ICT that will foster development of the information economy among the information
 poor. I suggest that the now-mature Free and Open Source Software paradigm, which has already produced widely-used enterprise-class
 applications, can be harnessed in support of these ends.
