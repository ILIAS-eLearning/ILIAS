# ILIAS composer guidelines 

**New dependencies MUST be approved by the Jour Fixe of the ILIAS society.**

To propose a new dependency, create a Pull Request on GitHub that contains the
proposed changes to `composer.json`, name it like "Add library XYZ" and assign
the "jour fixe"-label.

## Composer dependency management
Composer distinguishes between two different category of dependencies the 
production and dev dependencies.

The production dependencies are saved in the *require* section of the composer.json
configuration. These are used by the production code of ILIAS. Tests and other development
logic don't use this libraries directly. 

The dev dependencies are saved in the *require-dev* section of the compser.json configuration.
These are libraries and tools dedicated to aid the development process. For example
PHPUnit to run and create unit tests.

### Dependencies for production
- Add a new library using composer, e.g. "composer require filp/whoops"
- Document the usage and your wrapper class in composer.json, e.g.:
```json
"filp/whoops" : {
  "source" : "github.com/filp/whoops",
  "used_version" : "v2.1.0",
  "wrapped_by" : null,
  "added_by" : "Denis Klöpfer <denis.kloepfer@concepts-and-training.de>",
  "last_update" : "2016-03-22",
  "last_update_by" : "Jörg Lützenkirchen <luetzenkirchen@leifos.com>",
  "approved-by": "Jour Fixe",
  "approved-date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
},
```

- Run "composer install --no-dev"
- Add all files to ILIAS git-repository and commit

### Dependencies for development
- Add a new library using composer, e.g. "composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit" 
- Do not add the installed dependencies in /libs/composer/vendor to the repository. 
- Commit changes of composer.json and composer.lock 

### Update a single dependency
- Search the name of dependency you like to update.
- Update by using "composer update --no-dev <DEPENDENCY_NAME>"
- Commit all changes in composer.lock, composer.json and the vendor folder

### Remove a dependency
#### Production
A production dependency can be removed with the following command:
```bash
composer remove <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
```
Afterwards all changes should be committed.
 
#### Development
A development dependency can be removed with the following command:
```bash
composer remove --dev <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
```
Afterwards all changes should be committed.

# Populate the Vendor-Directory
The vendor-directory contains code for the dependencies managed by composer and
the autoloader that allows PHP to automatically find classes. These need to be
created by composer before ILIAS will work.

To populate the vendor-directory for a production environment call in `lib\composer`:

```bash
composer install --no-dev
composer dump-autoload
```

To populate the vendor-directory for a development environment, use

```bash
composer install --dev
composer dump-autoload
```

instead.

# Create library patch

**New patches in dependencies MUST be confirmed by the Technical Board of the ILIAS society.**

To propose a new patch, create a Pull Request on GitHub that contains the proposed
changes, name it like "Patch library XYZ" and assign the "technical board"-label.

The composer plugin cweagans/composer-patches provides a way to apply patches to dependencies.
- First a patch has to be created with git which contains all the required changes. After the 
has to be moved to the .libs/composer/patches directory.
- Second create a patch entry in the composer.json. The patch section is located under extra->patches.

For example the patch entry for tcpdf looks like this:
```json
{
	"tecnickcom/tcpdf": {
				"ILIAS TCPDF Patches": "patches/tcpdf.patch"
			}
}
``` 
First the name of the library must be specified and as child all patches which should be 
applied to the library. The example shown above has only one patch with the description "ILIAS TCPDF Patches" and the
location "patches/tcpdf.patch".

Now composer applies the patch after the specified dependency is installed.
The output will look similar as the example shown bellow:
```
Gathering patches for root package.
Gathering patches for dependencies. This might take a minute.
  - Installing tecnickcom/tcpdf (6.2.12): Downloading (100%)         
  - Applying patches for tecnickcom/tcpdf
    patches/tcpdf.patch (ILIAS TCPDF Patches)

```
