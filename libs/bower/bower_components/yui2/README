YUI 2.x is deprecated. This code is preserved here as a legacy archive for any
poor soul who needs to work with it. Please use YUI 3.x (http://www.yuilibrary.com).

The source tree for YUI 2.x includes the following directories:

* api: Generated API docs for the entire library in HTML format.  These
     documents are build using YUI Doc from the contents of the src
     directory.
* build: Generated/built YUI files.  The built files are generated from
     the contents of the src directory.  Files are provided in full,
     commented form (suitable for debugging) and in minified form
     (suitable for deployment and use).
* sandbox: The sandbox directory contains works-in-progress, including
     unreleased future components, as well as experimental and/or
     demonstration code created by library authors.
* src: This directory contains the source code (JavaScript, CSS, image
     assets, ActionScript files) for the library. src also contains
     all module documentation, tests and examples. The
     src/common directory contains documentation, tests and examples
     that are not for a specific YUI component. All modifications to
     the library and its documentation should take place in this
     directory.

     The src directory also contains build.xml files, which can be
     used to build individual modules using the also-deprecated YUI
     Builder tool (http://github.com/yui/builder). The README in the
     componentbuild directory of the builder project
     covers installation and use of the build tool.
