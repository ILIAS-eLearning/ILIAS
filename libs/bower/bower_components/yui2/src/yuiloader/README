     will need to be modified in order to use the new version.
   * yuiloader now includes the yahoo and get components.  This removes the timing
     problems in the previous versions that forced one to use YAHOO_config or include
     yahoo.js on the page before yuiloader.
   * No longer uses YAHOO_config for loading, you must use YAHOO.util.YUILoader
   * Interacting with YAHOO.register or supplying a verifier function is no longer
     required to load non-YUI resources.
   * Supports script sandboxing.  Does not support x-domain sandboxing at this time

     using external scripts and the application needs to support Safari 2.x.
   * YUI metadata updates:
       * Added 'base', 'reset-fonts', 'get', 'json', 'simpleeditor', 'charts, and 'selector'
       * button and history are no longer beta components.
       * imageloader promoted from experimental to beta.

2.3.1
   * The "skin.overrides" property is now applied correctly.  Previously
     it was looking for "skin.override".

2.3.0
   * Initial release.  YUILoader can dynamically load the optimized list of dependencies
     for a given set of requirements.  It is designed to be the only YUI component you
     need on your page in order to get the library running.  It includes the pieces of YUI
     that it requires to work.  If you are using yuiloader.js, then you don't need the
     following:

     yahoo.js
     get.js
