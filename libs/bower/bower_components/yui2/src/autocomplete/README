AutoComplete Release Notes

*** version 2.9.0 ***

* Better support for forceSelection when typeAhead is enabled.
* Add formatEscapedResult() for implementers who need to escape potentially
untrustworthy result data for insertion into DOM.



*** version 2.8.2 ***
* No changes.



*** version 2.8.1 ***

* No changes.



*** version 2.8.0 ***

* Refactored the "isFocused" model to more simply and accurately describe if
the widget instance is active or inactive.
* Added expandContainer() and clearList() to support 'always show footer when
widget is active' feature.
* Added the property autoSnapContainer for better out-of-the-box support for inline
elements, such as labels and submit buttons. By default, autoSnapContainer is
true, but implementers can disable this feature if they do not use inline
elements and they want to eliminate the overhead of positioning the container
element before each time it expands.
* Added enableIntervalDetection().



*** version 2.7.0 ***

* Better support for dealing with Arrays, including pure Arrays sent by remote
DataSources, and empty Array result sets.



*** version 2.6.0 ***

* AutoComplete has a new required dependency on YAHOO.util.DataSource,
and the class YAHOO.widget.DataSource has been deprecated. As a result,
the following YAHOO.widget.DataSource properties have been ported to YAHOO.widget.AutoComplete:
   - queryMatchCase
   - queryMatchContains
   - queryMatchSubset

* The following YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR properties have been deprecated in favor of
the new customizeable YAHOO.widget.AutoComplete method generateRequest:
   - scriptQueryParam
   - scriptQueryAppend

* The YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR property responseStripAfter has been deprecated in favor
of the new customizeable YAHOO.util.DataSource method doBeforeParseData.

* Now always fires either dataReturnEvent or dataErrorEvent upon a DataSource
response, whether container opens or not due to instance losing focus. 

* Added textboxChangeEvent and containerPopulateEvent Custom Events.

* As a convenience, the formatResult() method now recieves a third parameter which
is the query matching string for the result.

* In order to eliminate certain race conditions with the typeAhead feature, added
typeAheadDelay of default 0.5.

* Added new method filterResults() for an easily customizeable local string-
matching algorithm.

* The dataRequestEvent now passes along the request as well as the query string.
 
* The style list-style:none has been set in the default CSS.


*** version 2.5.2 ***

* Empty responses of TYPE_FLAT no longer open empty container.

* Mac FF no longer submits form on enter-to-select suggestion.



*** version 2.5.1 ***

* No changes.



*** version 2.5.0 ***

* Fixed bug where Mac users were not able to input "&" or "(" characters.



*** version 2.4.0 ***

* Support for YUI JSON Utility.

* The allowBrowserAutocomplete property now supports cases when the user navigates
away from page via mean other than a form submission.

* Added support for integration with the Get Utility, for proxyless data
retrieval from dynamically loaded script nodes.

* Typing 'Enter' to select item no longer causes automatic form submission on
Mac browsers.



*** version 2.3.1 ***

* AutoComplete no longer throw a JavaScript error due to an invalid or
non-existent parent container. While a wrapper DIV element is still expected in
order to enable skinning (see 2.3.0 release note), a lack of such will not
cause an error.

* When suggestion container is collapsed, Mac users no longer need to type
Enter twice to submit input.



*** version 2.3.0 ***

* Applied new skinning model. Please note that in order to enable skinning,
AutoComplete now expects a wrapper DIV element around the INPUT element and the
container DIV element, in this fashion:

<div id="myAutoComplete">
    <input type="text" id="myInput">
    <div id="myContainer"></div>
</div>

* The default queryDelay value has been changed to 0.2. In low-latency
implementations (e.g., when queryDelay is set to 0 against a local
JavaScript DataSource), typeAhead functionality may experience a race condition
when retrieving the value of the textbox. To avoid this problem, implementers
are advised not to set the queryDelay value too low.

* Fixed runtime property value validation.

* Implemented new method doBeforeSendQuery().

* Implemented new method destroy().

* Added support for latest JSON lib http://www.json.org/json.js.

* Fixed forceSelection issues with matched selections and multiple selections.

* No longer create var oAnim in global scope.

* The properties alwaysShowContainer and useShadow should not be enabled together.

* There is a known issue in Firefox where the native browser autocomplete
attribute cannot be disabled programmatically on input boxes that are in use.





**** version 2.2.2 ***

* No changes.



*** version 2.2.1 ***

* Fixed form submission in Safari bug.
* Fixed broken DS_JSArray support for minQueryLength=0.

YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR.TYPE_JSON
YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR.TYPE_XML
YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR.TYPE_FLAT
YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR.ERROR_DATAXHR

* The property minQueryLength now supports zero and negative number values for
DS_JSFunction and DS_XHR objects, to enable null or empty string queries and to disable
AutoComplete functionality altogether, respectively.

* Enabling the alwaysShowContainer feature will no longer send containerExpandEvent or
containerCollapseEvent.

specify an https URL to avoid IE security warnings when working with sites over
SSL.

may result in unexpected behavior.

* Initial release

* In order to enable the useIFrame property, it should be set in the
constructor.

* On some browsers, defining delimiter characters while enabling forceSelection
may result in unexpected behavior.
