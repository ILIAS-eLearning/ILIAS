YUI Library - Uploader - Release Notes

2.9.0
  * Bug fixes
     * Added escapes to all non-HTML text written to innerHTML.
     * Fixed bug #2527851, where an error was thrown when simUpload limit was larger than the number of files being uploaded.
     * Fixed bug #2528386, where removeFile() wasn't cancelling an upload.
     * Fixed bug #2528387, where cancelling an invalid id caused an error.
     * Fixed bug #2528785, where upload process stopped if errors occurred.

2.8.1
  * Bug fixes
     * Corrected the version of the Uploader SWF that is included in the /build directory

2.8.0
  * Bug fixes
     * The queue for uploadAll() has been reimplemented (contribution by Jordan Brough) to work as a proper queue.
  * Added uploadThese() method (contribution by Jordan Brough) to upload a specific subset of selected files.

2.7.0
  * Bug fixes
     * All global variables were converted to member variables of YAHOO
     * Changes in how the specific instances of uploader are tracked when events are dispatched from Flash (to avoid initialization race conditions particularly visible in Firefox 3 with AdBlock)
  * New optional forceTransparent argument was added to the Uploader constructor: if true, it forces Flash to render the Flash app as transparent even if it's running in the "button" mode (for use with non-rectangular PNG buttons with transparency).

2.6.0
  * Changes due to new security rules in Flash Player 10:
     * Browse() function has been eliminated; the uploader now has to have an internal Flash UI.
     * The Uploader can be rendered as a transparent Flash layer, or as a skinned button.
     * Mouse events on the Uploader are exposed to JavaScript.

  * Known issues:
	 * The intended behavior of the uploader is not to send any cookies with its requests. Due to a limitation 
	   of the Windows networking library, when running in IE, the uploader sends the cookies with the upload.
	   However, you cannot rely on this behavior for authentication, because it's absent in other browsers. 
	   As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie
	   to the upload request.
	 * There are some known issues around keyboard interaction with the uploader. In particular, when the 
	   uploader is rendered as a transparent layer, it does not respond to keyboard presses - only mouse
	   functionality is available. When the uploader is rendered as an image, it receives "Space" and "Enter" 
	   key presses as triggers, but only if the focus is on the uploader component itself. Keyboard tabbing 
	   to the component behaves differently in different browsers.
	 * Because of Flash limitations, the uploader does not support basic authentication.
	 * Because of Flash limitations, the uploader behavior when working through a proxy server is inconsistent 
	   and unreliable.
     * When uploading to HTTPS servers, be aware that Flash does not support self-signed certificates. You 
       would need to obtain certificates from a recognized certificate authority.

2.5.1
  * Fix to ensure UploadCancel fires when expected.
  
2.5.0
  * Experimental release
