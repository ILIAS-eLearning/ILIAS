2.9.0
    * Add fix for IE 9 throwing an error from set()
      "Invalid this pointer used as target for method call". Best guess
      is that the style collection used for off-DOM calculations was getting
      corrupted.

2.8.1
    * No change

2.8.0
    * Added support for set(selector, cssTextString)

2.7.0
    * Initial beta release
