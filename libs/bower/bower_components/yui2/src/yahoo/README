2.2.2

  * No change

2.2.1

  * YAHOO.lang.isObject returns false for null
  * YAHOO.lang.isArray no longer generates an error when the argument is null/undefined
  * Better error messages for YAHOO.lang.augment/extend failures that are usually due
    to missing dependencies.

2.2.0a

  * Fixed a typo that prevented the proper detection of multiple YAHOO_config listeners

2.2.0

  * Added configuration of the library via a YAHOO_config object defined
    prior to the reference to the library.  Currently it supports a listener
    parameter that will execute every time a new module YUI module is loaded.

  * Added YAHOO.register & YAHOO.getVersion for version stamping modules.

  * Added YAHOO.env which is the home for the information about the loaded
    YUI modules, and will host more info later.

  * YAHOO.util.Lang was relocated to this package and is now YAHOO.lang.
    YAHOO.extend and YAHOO.augment have moved to env (the original
    functions still work).

0.12.2

  * No change

0.12.1

  * No change

0.12.0

   * Added YAHOO.augment, which copies all or part of the prototype of one
     object to another.

   * YAHOO.namespace now can create multiple namespaces.

   * Added an optional third parameter to YAHOO.extend: overrides.  It takes
     an object literal of properties/methods to apply to the subclass
     prototype, overriding the superclass if present.

0.11.4

   * Changed window.YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {} to
     if (typeof YAHOO == "undefined") YAHOO = {} because the previous statement
     contributed to a memory leak in IE6 when the library was hosted in an
     iframe.

0.11.3

   * Changed var YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {} to window.YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {}.
     This fixes an issue in IE where YAHOO would get overwritten if previously
     defined via array notation (window["YAHOO"]).

0.11.0

   * Added YAHOO.extend, which provides an easy way to assign the prototype,
     constructor, and superclass properties inheritance properties.  It also
     prevents the constructor of the superclass from being exectuted twice.

0.10.0

   * Added YAHOO.log that provides a safe way to plumb logging statements in
     code that will work if the logging component isn't available.
