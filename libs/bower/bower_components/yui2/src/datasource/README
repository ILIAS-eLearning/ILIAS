DataSource Release Notes

**** version 2.9.0 ****

* Fixed YAHOO.util.Number.format regression for custom decimal separators in
numbers smaller than 1000
* For consistency, JSON parser functions are now called with DataSource instance
as the context.

**** version 2.8.2 ****

* No changes.



***** version 2.8.1 ****

* No changes.


**** version 2.8.0 ****

* Negative formatting support in YAHOO.util.Number.format().
* Added useXPath property for XPath support when parsing XML data.



**** version 2.7.0 ****

* The parseNumber() method will now return null for the following values:
null, undefined, NaN, ""
* YAHOO.util.Number.format() will now return "" for the following values:
null, undefined, NaN, ""
* Added support for customizeable scope in JS Function DataSources.
* Added doBeforeGetScriptNode() as a hook to access the script URL immediately
before it is processed by the Get Utility in Script Node DataSources.
* Added parseJSONArgs instance property to allow extra params be passed to JSON.parse routine.
* XHR instances configured with responseType TYPE_HTMLTABLE now create the requisite DOM table from the XHR responseText



**** version 2.6.0 ****

* GA release.
* The DataSource class has been refactored into a DataSourceBase base class and
the subclasses LocalDataSource, FunctionDataSource, XHRDataSource, and
ScriptNodeDataSource. While backward compatibility of the YAHOO.util.DataSource
constructor has been maintained, implementers should be aware that calling
new YAHOO.util.DataSource() now actually returns one of these
subclasses. Implementers can alternatively call a subclass constructor directly.
The DataSource constructor returns one of the subclasses based on the oLiveData
passed to it, or the dataType config value. This class-based architecture no
longer meaningfully supports swapping data types on the fly.
* Empty responses of TYPE_FLAT no longer return empty string results.
* Parsing of totalRecords is no longer supported as a top-leval schema value.
Implementers should access this value of using a metaField.
* XML parsing has been updated for support of CDATA sections and long text values
split into multiple nodes.
* Now passing oCallback object to doBeforeCallback() and doBeforeParseData() methods.
* YAHOO.util.Date now supports strftime formatting.

**** version 2.5.2 ****

* No changes.

**** version 2.5.1 ****

* Replaced custom function parsing with parsed/walked value locators for
    responseSchema.resultsList, .fields, etc
* Added metaFields to responseSchema to capture arbitrary response data

**** version 2.5.0 ****

* doBeforeCallback() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* handleResponse() -
      o oCallback is now an object literal pointing to success and failure
      handlers and can contain scope and argument values.
      o The oCaller argument is now deprecated.
      o When callback function is passed oRequest and oParsedResponse values,
      the oParsedResponse object now consistently returns the following values:
            + tId (Number)
            + results (Array)
            + error (Boolean)
            + totalResults (Number) (when available)
* makeConnection() -
      o oCallback is now an object literal pointing to success and failure
      handlers and can contain scope and argument values.
      o The oCaller argument is now deprecated.
* parseArrayData() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* parseHTMLTableData() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* parseJsonData() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* parseTextData() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* parseXMLData() - The second argument is now oFullResponse rather than oRawResponse.
* sendRequest() -
      o oCallback is now an object literal pointing to success and failure
      handlers and can contain scope and argument values.
      o The oCaller argument is now deprecated.
* setInterval() -
      o oCallback is now an object literal pointing to success and failure
      handlers and can contain scope and argument values.
      o The oCaller argument is now deprecated.
* cacheRequestEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* dataErrorEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* getCachedResponseEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* requestEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* responseCacheEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* responseEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.
* responseParseEvent - oArgs.caller is now deprecated in favor of oCallback object literal.



**** version 2.4.0 ****

* Support for YUI JSON Utility.

* Implemented setInterval(), clearInterval(), and clearAllIntervals() for polling.

* Text data parsing algorithm now tolerates newlines within and at the end of data.



**** version 2.3.1 ****

* No changes.



**** version 2.3.0 ****

* DataSource requests over XHR no longer automatically insert a "?" in the URIs
between the host and the query. Implementers should explicitly include the
question mark if it is required by your server. Please refer to the DataTable XHR
examples for implementation details.

* DataSource provides the following static type conversion methods:
DataSource.parseDate(), DataSource.parseNumber(), and DataSource.parseString().
These are executed in the scope of the DataSource instance.

* DataSource now supports the following values for the property xhrConnMode:
    "queueRequests"
    "allowAll"
    "cancelStaleRequests"
    "ignoreStaleResponses"

* Added property connMethodPost to support POST requests.

* The parsed response object passed to the callback function now has the
following properties:
    tId {Number} Unique transaction ID
    results {Array} Array of parsed data results
    error {Boolean} True if there was an error



**** version 2.2.2 ***

* No changes.



**** version 2.2.1 ***

* Fixed parseTextData() to longer reverse-order data or truncate first record.
* Fixed bug where data values of 0 (zero) were being converted to empty string.
* Fixed erroneous undefined values created by parseDataArray().
* Callback functions now receive an additional argument in the form of a boolean
to indicate data error.
* Support for nested JSON data.
* Support for responseShema.fields.converter to take string response and custom
convert data type.
* Added static converter methods YAHOO.util.DataSource.convertNumber and
YAHOO.util.DataSource.convertDate.
* Improved type checking with YAHOO.lang.



**** version 2.2.0 ***

* Beta release.
