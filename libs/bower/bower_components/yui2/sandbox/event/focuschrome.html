		Method to reproduce: load this test webpage into an internet capable browser, click on/ highlight the text 'please select a date range'
		Expected functionality:
			a javascript alert box appears reading "writing javascript" whilst the page is loading,
			a javascript alert box appears reading "entered function" when the text is clicked/ highlighted
		Observed functionality:
			Using Windows 7,
			As Expected functionality in IE 8.0.7600.16385, Firefox 3.6.12, Opera 10.63 .

			When using Chrome 7.0.517.44
			a javascript alert box appears reading "writing javascript" whilst the page is loading,
			no javascript alert box appears when the text is clicked/ highlighted

		Additional:
			Similar reduction of functionality can be observed listening for "focusout" event, instead of "focusin" (line 41)
		Supposition:
			This may be observable across many browser versions of Chrome
		Conjecture:
			Chrome isn't passing the blur/ focus events in the same way as the other browsers, meaning that the YUI library can't aggregate the non-bubbling events in the same way, causing it to fail.

		yahoo-dom-event is the YUI 'yahoo', 'dom' and 'event' modules combined into one file for faster loading.
		Documentation at http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/ suggests that the functionality would only need 'yahoo' and 'event',
		but the bug was originally discovered using the combined, so I have included both, and both exhibit reduced functionality, as above
