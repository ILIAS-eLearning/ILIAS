Version 2.6.0 

  * Added del,ins{text-decoration:none;} per SF-1957908
  * KNOWN ISSUE:
    Beginning in Opera 9.5, a padding value of 0 on radio 
    buttons and checkboxes prevents Opera from rendering 
    their visually attractive checkmarks and filled circles

    however you can apply this patch if you desire:
   	input[type="checkbox"],input[type="radio"] {padding:1px;}
