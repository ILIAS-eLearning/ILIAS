YUI Library - Fonts - Release Notes

Version 2.7.0

   * Added button element to rule adjusting font sizes for some form elements.
     Bug #2359418

     scalable via IE8's zooming feature, but not via IE8's "View > Text Size." 

Version 2.6.0

   * Added font reduction and face restatement for select, input, button, and textarea
   * Comments and formatting updates.
   * KNOWN ISSUE: 
     In IE8 Beta 2, user-initiated Text Size adjustment does not work because our keyword
