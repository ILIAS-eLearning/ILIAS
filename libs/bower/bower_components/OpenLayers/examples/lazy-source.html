title: Lazy Source
shortdesc: Example of setting a layer source after construction.
docs: >
  <p>Typically, the source for a layer is provided to the layer constructor.
  If you need to set a layer source after construction, this can be
  done with the <code>layer.setSource()</code> method.</p>
  <p>The layer in the map above is constructed with no source.  Use the
  links below to set/unset the layer source.  A layer is not rendered
  until its source is set.</p>
