shortdesc: Example of a attributions visibily change on map resize, to collapse them on small maps.
docs: >
  When the map gets too small because of a resize, the attribution will be collapsed.
  This is because the <code>collapsible</code> option is set to true if the width
  of the map gets smaller than 600 pixels.
