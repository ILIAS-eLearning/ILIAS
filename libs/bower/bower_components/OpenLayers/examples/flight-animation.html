title: Flight Animation
shortdesc: Demonstrates how to animate flights with ´postcompose´.
docs: >
  This example shows how to use <b>postcompose</b> and <b>vectorContext</b> to
  animate flights. A great circle arc between two airports is calculated using
  <a href="https://github.com/springmeyer/arc.js">arc.js</a> and then the flight
  paths are animated with <b>postcompose</b>. The flight data is provided by
  <a href="http://openflights.org/data.html">OpenFlights</a> (a simplified data
  set from the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/animating-flight-paths/">
  Mapbox.js documentation</a> is used).
