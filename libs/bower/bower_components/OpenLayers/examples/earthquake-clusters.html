title: Earthquake Clusters
shortdesc: Demonstrates the use of style geometries to render source features of a cluster.
docs: >
  <p>This example parses a KML file and renders the features as clusters on a vector layer.  The styling in this example is quite involved. Single earthquake locations
  (rendered as stars) have a size relative to their magnitude. Clusters have an opacity relative to the number of features in the cluster, and a size that represents
  the extent of the features that make up the cluster. When clicking or hovering on a cluster, the individual features that make up the cluster will be shown.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, we make heavy use of style functions and <code>ol.style.Style#geometry</code>.</p>
