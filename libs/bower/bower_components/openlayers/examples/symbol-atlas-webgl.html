title: Symbols with WebGL
shortdesc: Using symbols in an atlas with WebGL.
docs: >
  <p>When using symbol styles with WebGL, OpenLayers would render the symbol
  on a temporary image and would create a WebGL texture for each image. For a
  better performance, it is recommended to use atlas images (similar to
  image sprites with CSS), so that the number of textures is reduced. OpenLayers
  provides an <code>AtlasManager</code>, which when passed to the constructor
  of a symbol style, will create atlases for the symbols.</p>
