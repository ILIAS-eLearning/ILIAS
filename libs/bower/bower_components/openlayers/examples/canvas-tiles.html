title: Canvas Tiles
shortdesc: Renders tiles with coordinates for debugging.
docs: >
  The black grid tiles are generated on the client with an HTML5 canvas. The
  displayed tile coordinates are OpenLayers tile coordinates. These increase
  from bottom to top, but standard XYZ tiling scheme coordinates increase from
  top to bottom. To calculate the `y` for a standard XYZ tile coordinate, use
  `-y - 1`.
