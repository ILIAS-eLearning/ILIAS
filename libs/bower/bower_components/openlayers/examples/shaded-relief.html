title: Shaded Relief
shortdesc: Calculate shaded relief from elevation data
docs: >
  <p>
    This example uses a <code>ol.source.Raster</code> to generate data
    based on another source.  The raster source accepts any number of
    input sources (tile or image based) and runs a pipeline of
    operations on the input data.  The return from the final
    operation is used as the data for the output source.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, a single tiled source of elevation data is used as input.
    The shaded relief is calculated in a single "image" operation.  By setting
    <code>operationType: 'image'</code> on the raster source, operations are
    called with an <code>ImageData</code> object for each of the input sources.
    Operations are also called with a general purpose <code>data</code> object.
    In this example, the sun elevation and azimuth data from the inputs above
    are assigned to this <code>data</code> object and accessed in the shading
    operation.  The shading operation returns an array of <code>ImageData</code>
    objects.  When the raster source is used by an image layer, the first
    <code>ImageData</code> object returned by the last operation in the pipeline
    is used for rendering.
