title: View Min-Zoom
shortdesc: Demonstrates how the view's minimum zoom level can be changed.
docs: >
  The <code>minZoom</code> option for a view limits how far out you can
  zoom.  This property can be updated by calling <code>view.setMinZoom(newMinZoom)</code>.
  In this example, the minimum zoom level is set so that you only see one
  world at a time.  Resize your browser window to change the threshold.
