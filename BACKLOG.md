# I should...

* write proper documentation for my classes
* write tests for all classes and constructs
* write a proper form abstraction that hides plumbing like name source

# I could...

* elaborate representation of input to make it read only and take `$_FILES` into
  account
* let html_tag take a flexible number of HTMLs and concat them itself
