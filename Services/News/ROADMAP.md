# News Roadmap

## Short Term

### News Read Information

ILIAS (still) stores, if a user has read an news item or not. The presentation of this status needs to be checked and the necessity of this feature should be discussed, since it is privacy related.

## Mid Term

### Public News Handling

The way public automatically created news entries are handled in RSS feeds (no access check), is a constant source of misinterpretation, see e.g. #28803. This concept needs to be improved.
