/**
* Class ilObjNullDAV
*
* Null Resources are used by WebDAV clients, to lock a resource name in the repository.
*
* Cited from RFC 2518, chapter 3 "Terminology":
* "Null Resource - A resource which responds with 404 (Not Found) to any HTTP/1.1 or
* DAV method except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS and LOCK. A Null Resource MUST NOT appear
* as a member of its parent collection."
*
* Cited from RFC 2518, chapter 7.4 "Write Locks and Null Resources":
* "It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to lock the name.
* A write locked null resource, referred to as a lock-null resource, MUST respond with
* a 404 (Not Found) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) to any HTTP71.1 or DAV methods except
* for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS, PROPFIND, LOCK and UNLOCK. A lock-null resource MUST appear
* as a member of its parent collection. Additionally the lock-null resource MUST have
* defined on it all mandatory DAV properties. Most of these properties such as all
* the get properties, will have no value as a lock-null resource does not support the
* GET method. Lock-Null resources MUST have defined values for lockdiscovery and
* supportedlock properties.
* Until a method such as PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on the lock-null resource
* the resource MUST stay in the lock-null state. However, once a PUT or MKCOL is
* successfully executed on a lock-null resouce the resource ceases to be in the lock-null
* state.
* If the resource is unlocked, for any reason, without a PUT, MKCOL, or similar method
* having been successfully executed upon it then the resource MUST return to the null state."
*
* Null-resources are used by class.ilDAVSerrev.php for the following use cases:
* 
* Use case 1: Creating a new file resource
* 1. Client sends a PROPFIND request on the name of the resource
* 2. Server returns 404 (Not Found)
* 3. Client sends a LOCK request on the name of the resource.
* 4. Server creates a Null Resource and a Lock on the name.
* 5. Client sends a PUT request on the name and passes the resource content along
* 6. Server converts the Null Resource into a File resource and stores the resource content
* 7. Client sends an UNLOCK request on the name of the resource
* 8. Server deletes the Lock.
*
* Use case 2: Creating a new collection resource
* 1. Client sends a PROPFIND request on the name of the resource
* 2. Server returns 404 (Not Found)
* 3. Client sends a LOCK request on the name of the resource.
* 4. Server creates a Null Resource and a Lock on the name.
* 5. Client sends a MKCOL request on the name
* 6. Server converts the Null Resource into a Collection resource and stores the resource content
* 7. Client sends an UNLOCK request on the name of the resource
* 8. Server deletes the Lock.
*
* Use case 3: Locking and Unlocking a null resource
* 1. Client sends a LOCK request on the name of the resource for some reason.
* 2. Server creates a Null Resource and a Lock on the name.
* 3. (Some time later) Client sends a UNLOCK request on the name of the resource
* 4. Server deletes the Null Resource
* 5. Server deletes the Lock.
*
* Use case 4: Locking and timeout on lock on a null resource
* 1. Client sends a LOCK request on the name of the resource for some reason.
* 2. Server creates a Null Resource and a Lock on the name.
* 3. (Some time later) the lock times out.
* 4. Server deletes the Null Resource
* 5. Server deletes the Lock.
