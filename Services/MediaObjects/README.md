# MediaObjects

## Business Rules

Access Handling
- Media objects can be re-used, e.g. when pages are copied or media objects are inserted from a media pool in a learning module.
- All references "are equal". The container handles write access to the media object. This mostly means that write access to a container like a learning module gives write access to the media object.
