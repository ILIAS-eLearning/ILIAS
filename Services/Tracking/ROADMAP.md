Note: Some of the rules listed in this roadmap may be superseded by general ILIAS rules in the future.

## Known Issues

According to [1], switching between different chapter assignments in Learning Modules of type "Manual per Chapter" always deletes the user status.

## Mid Term

- The API needs a revision, should get rid of static calls and be available through the DIC.
- Keep the user status for LMs ("Manual per Chapter").

## Long Term
