# Roadmap
- All the steps in this roadmap depend on the availability of funding for
refactoring.
- There are currently no new features on the roadmap.

## Short Term
- Apply Sustainability Package from PHP8-Refactoring

## Mid Term
- Continue application of the Sustainability Package from PHP8-Refactoring

## Long Term
### Refactoring and Restructuring
Work on a more encompasing refactoring of Services\AccesControl will be started in
the mid term, but it will take a while to produce results.
In the Long Term Services\AccessControl will be moved to a more collaborative
maintenance model. The refactoring aims to facilitate this and provide an easy
to understand Service.
