## Mid Term

### User Service in DIC

Currently the user service is only represented by an ilObjUser object of the current user in the DIC. However ilObjUser is not a real interface for other components, since it reveals lots of internals that should be hidden.

A decent user service interface needs to be defined that should fit the needs of other components through a well defined interface in the future.
