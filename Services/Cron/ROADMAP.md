# Roadmap

## Short Term

**Component Logger**

Introduce a component specific logger for the "cron" component.

**Advanced Schedule Options**

To offer advanced schedule options for administrators a *crontab*-like
syntax should be supported to define the due date of a job. For parsing purposes
[PHP Cron Expression Parser](https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression)
could be suggested (needs a Jour Fixe decission).
