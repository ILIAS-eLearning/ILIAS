## Copyright Administration

ILIAS 8 comes pre-installed with six Creative Commons licenses as well
as 'All rights reserved'. Copyright can be selected for objects that support
LOM when 'Enable Copyright Selection' is checked in the 'Copyright'-tab
of the Metadata Administration. The copyright of an object can be chosen
along with and is persisted in its LOM, see the subtab 'LOM' of the
'Metadata'-tab in the object.

Installations which were not set up from scratch, but upgraded from a
lower ILIAS version, are not retroactively equipped with the current
version of the CC licenses. These can however be added manually.

### Default License

As long as copyright selection is active, every ILIAS object which supports
LOM is shown as being under one of the available licenses. Objects for which
no copyright is explicitely chosen are shown as being under the default
license. This license is always listed first in the 'Available Copyrights' table in
the Metadata Administration and cannot be deleted, but it can be edited. If 
not configured otherwise, 'All rights reserved' is the default.
