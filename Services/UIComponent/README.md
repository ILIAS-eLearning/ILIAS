# UIComponent Service

The UI Component Service provides wrappers for several UI Components to be re-used. Note that many of those components
have been deprecated, since we are migrating much of the content of this service to src/UI. If you feel that you need
to use one of those components nevertheless for new developments, maybe think about providing a PR to src/UI to add the
missing feature. This would be highly appreciated.

## UserInterfaceHook Pluginslot 
This plugin slot has been published as stable with ILIAS 4.2. The goal of the user interface plugin slot is to allow simple
 modifications of standard components of the ILIAS user interface. The slot is defined by the UIComponent Service of ILIAS 
 and named "UserInterfaceHook". This means all plugins have to be installed into directories at:

`Customizing/global/plugins/Services/UIComponent/UserInterfaceHook/<Plugin_Name>`

The ID of the UIComponent Service is "ui", the ID of the slot is "uihk". These are used as prefixes together with your 
plugin id for database tables and for language variable identifiers:

DB Table / Language VariablePrefixes: `ui_uihk_<Plugin_ID>_`

## Plugin Directory Structure
A user interface plugin has the following minimum file/directory structure:
```
<PluginName> (Directory)
	classes (Directory)
		class.il<PluginName>Plugin.php
		class.il<PluginName>UIHookGUI.php
	plugin.php
```

### ilPluginNamePlugin.php
Default Structure:

```
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . "/../vendor/autoload.php";

/**
 * Previously there was not that much to do here except defining the Plugins name.
 *
 * Since the introduction of the Global Screen, this can be also used however, to manipulate the Main Menu of ILIAS.
 * Note that this does not only work for ilUserInterfaceHookPlugin plugins, but for all plugins descending ilPlugin.
 *
 * Class ilPluginNamePlugin
 */

	 */
	function getPluginName() {
		return 'UIHookDemo';
	}

	/**
	 * This method is used to promote a plugins own GlobalScreen provider. With such a provider, one can easily 
	 * extend parts of the Global Screen such as the Main Menu. Note that this method is available for all types
	 * of plugins.
	 * 
	 * @return AbstractStaticPluginMainMenuProvider
	 */
	public function promoteGlobalScreenProvider(): AbstractStaticPluginMainMenuProvider {

	 * by returning a closure returning a custom renderer. E.g:
	 *
	 * return function(\ILIAS\DI\Container $c){
	 *   return new CustomRenderer();
	 * };
	 *
	 * Note: Note that plugins might conflict by replacing the renderer, so only use if you
	 * are sure, that no other plugin will do this for a given context.
	 *

		return $dic->raw('ui.renderer');
	}

	/**

```

### class.ilPluginNameUIHookGUI.php
Note that the methods of this class are depricated since ILIAS 6.0. Only use if absolutely necessary. Note that
many scenarios might be better served by using the Global Screen Service or the UI Components (See above method).

```
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . "/../vendor/autoload.php";

 * This is where the actual magic of the GUI modifications take place.

	 * as provided here:
	 * - The generation of html might be performed twice (especially if REPLACE is used).
	 * - There is limited access to data used to generate the original html. If needed this data needs to be gathered again.

	 * - ilUIHookPluginGUI::PREPEND (Prepend your HTML to the default HTML)

	 * @param array $a_par array of parameters (depend on $a_comp and $a_part), e.g. name of the used tpl.

	{

		 * Tabs are not migrated to the UI Components/Global Screen, so they still might be manipulated here.
		 *
		 * Note that you currently do not get information in $a_comp
		 * here. So you need to use general GET/POST information

		 * to determine the context.
		 */

		}
	}

}
```

### Example Plugin
A working example for ILIAS 6.0 can be found at: https://github.com/Amstutz/UIHookDemo

The example show how to:
* Add Tabs by modify  GUI
* Replace the Metabar of ILIAS by Using getHTML
* Render parts of the page as json
* Add a new Item the the Main Bar of ILIAS (aka Main Menu)

There is also an advanced demo of how the Main Menu can be extended by using the new Global Screen service. The
extension adds top items that can be shown if a set of global roles is attached to the current user. You can see this
additional type in the Administration > Main Menu by adding a new Top Item.
