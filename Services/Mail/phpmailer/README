# PHPMailer - A full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP

## Class Features

- Probably the world's most popular code for sending email from PHP!
- Used by many open-source projects: Drupal, SugarCRM, Yii, Joomla!
  and many more
- Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
- Redundant SMTP servers
- Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
- Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM)
  component
- SMTP authentication
- Native language support
- Word wrap
- Compatible with PHP 5.0 and later
- Much more!

## Why you might need it

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code. The only PHP function that
supports this is the mail() function. However, it does not provide any
assistance for making use of popular features such as HTML-based emails and
attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad
overlapping RFCs, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated
formatting and encoding rules - the vast majority of code that you'll find
online that uses the mail() function directly is just plain wrong! *Please*
don't be tempted to do it yourself - if you don't use PHPMailer, there are
many other excellent libraries that you should look at before rolling your
own - try SwiftMailer, Zend_Mail, eZcomponents etc.

The PHP mail() function usually sends via a local mail server, typically
fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD and OS X platforms, however,
Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated
SMTP implementation allows email sending on Windows platforms without a
local mail server.

## Installation

Copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into somewhere that's in your PHP
include_path setting.

## A Simple Example

```php
<?php
require 'class.phpmailer.php';

$mail = new PHPMailer;

$mail->IsSMTP();                                      // Set mailer to use SMTP
$mail->Host = 'smtp1.example.com;smtp2.example.com';  // Specify main and backup server
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;                               // Enable SMTP authentication
$mail->Username = 'jswan';                            // SMTP username
$mail->Password = 'secret';                           // SMTP password
$mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls';                            // Enable encryption, 'ssl' also accepted

$mail->From = 'from@example.com';
$mail->FromName = 'Mailer';
$mail->AddAddress('josh@example.net', 'Josh Adams');  // Add a recipient
$mail->AddAddress('ellen@example.com');               // Name is optional
$mail->AddReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
$mail->AddCC('cc@example.com');
$mail->AddBCC('bcc@example.com');

$mail->WordWrap = 50;                                 // Set word wrap to 50 characters
$mail->AddAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         // Add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    // Optional name
$mail->IsHTML(true);                                  // Set email format to HTML

$mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
$mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
$mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

if(!$mail->Send()) {
   echo 'Message could not be sent.';
   echo 'Mailer Error: ' . $mail->ErrorInfo;
   exit;
}

echo 'Message has been sent';
```

You'll find plenty more to play with in the `examples` folder.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization
PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the `languages` folder you'll find
numerous translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter.
Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)
language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify
a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```php
// To load the French version
$mail->SetLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

## Documentation

You'll find some basic user-level docs in the docs folder, and you can
re-generate complete API-level documentation using the `makedocs2.sh` shell
script in the docs folder, though you'll need to install
[PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) first.

## Tests

You'll find a PHPUnit test script in the `test` folder.

## Contributing

Please submit bug reports, suggestions and pull requests to the [Google Code
tracker](https://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/phpmailer/issues/list).

We're particularly interested in fixing edge-cases, expanding test coverage
and updating translations.

Please *don't* use the sourceforge project any more.
