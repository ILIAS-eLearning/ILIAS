/**
 * This class forms an interface between the existing ILIAS mail contexts and the requirements of Mustache.
 * In the old system, it was possible to gradually replace individual placeholders via the contexts.
 * This is now done by Mustache and requires a single source. If a placeholder does not exist in this source,
 * then it will be replaced with NULL. Mustache takes two steps to find the placeholder.
 * On the one hand the check whether it would be theoretically possible and the actual query for the value
 * if the check is successful. This is done in this class using the two magic methods.
 * With the introduction of this interface, the ILIAS mail contexts do not have to be changed for Mustache.
