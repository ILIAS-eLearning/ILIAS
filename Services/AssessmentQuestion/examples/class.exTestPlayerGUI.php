     * Both methods getQuestionPresentation and getSolutionPresentation gets an instance of ilAsqSolution injected.

     * In case of presenting the best solution the required ilAsqSolution instance can be retrieved
     * from the ilAsqQuestion interface.
     *
     * For any existing user response that is to be presented with the question the instance
     * implementing ilAsqSolution can be requested from the ilAsqFactory using the solutionId

     * The ilAsqSolution interface method initFromServerRequest is to be used to initialize the object instance
     * with the user response. With the current concept the newly introduced \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface
     * needs to be injected to this method, but may simply passing $_POST could be an alternative.
     * This depends on the future strategy of abstracting the http server request in ILIAS.
     *
     * After having this solution saved, the consuming component needs to register the now available solutionId
     * together with the questionId and the userId. Additionally this ilAsqSolution instance can be used
     * with a question corresponding ilAsqResultCalculator to retrieve the information about right/wrong
     * (used for e.g. answer status in CTM's test sequence) and reached points (used as a future ilTestResult)
     * to be stored as any result within the consuming component.
     *
     * After the first submission of any user response the consuming component needs to provide the corresponsing
     * solutionId to request the existing ilAsqSolution instance from the ilAsqFactory for every additional submit.
     *
     * The way harvesting and handling solution data in short:
     * - post submit gets parsed by ilAsqSolution
     * - ilAsqResultCalculator calculates points and right/wrong
     * - the test object can use these information for different purposes
     * - points can be saved as an ilTestResult referenced by the questionId and the participantId
     * - right/wrong can be used for determining the correct feedbacks for the feedback loop
     * - right/wrong can be used as the answer status within the CTM test sequence
