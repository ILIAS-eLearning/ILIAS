Note: Some of the rules listed in this roadmap may be superseded by general ILIAS rules in the future.

## Known Issues

According to [1] files assigned to wikis or page objects are indexed but the index does not contain sufficient information (e.g subtype 'file', 'chapter', ...) to create an unambigous link the the respective object. 

## Short Term
