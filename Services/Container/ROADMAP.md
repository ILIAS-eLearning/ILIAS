## Mid Term

### Use Listing Panels in Container Renderer

It would be good to solve the Deck/Listing conceptual issues in general, see [UI Roadmap](../../src/UI/ROADMAP.md#balance-or-unify-cards-and-items).

The following issues need to be conceptually solved before a migration can be done:
- Presentation of Preconditions
- Presentation of Session Materials
- Presentation of Show Previous/Next Sessions

### Revise Resource List Handling in Page Content

- The behaviour of resource lists in container content pages seems to be a constant source of confusion. The concept should be revised. See [readme](README.md#business-rules). See also FW proposal at https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6012_1357.html

### Remove Download Files Background Task

- This is purely files related and should be moved to another service.
