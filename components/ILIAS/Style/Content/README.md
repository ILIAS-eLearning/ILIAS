# Content Styles

This section of the documentation covers concepts and business rules. For technical documentation, refer to [README-technical.md](./README-technical.md).

## Access Control

Content styles are not secured by any access control (similar to system styles). The performance benefits are considered more valuable than the added security of restricting access to these resources.
