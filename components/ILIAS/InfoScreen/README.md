# Info Screen

## Business Rules

- In "Administration > Repository Objects > Repository" the setting "Show Tracking Information" controls if the number of non-anonymous users and distinct accessing users are displayed. This information is only displayed for users having "edit settings" (write) permission.
- Object creation date and owner is only displayed for users having "edit settings" (write) permission.

### WIP

Feature not fully developed, but JF decided the general goal.
- Enabling 'Info Tab' should always be placed in section 'Presentation', see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_4886_1357.html
- Object titles in containers are always linked if "visible" permission is given (even if the info tab is hidden), see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_4886_1357.html Note: this is not implemented yet (ILIAS 7).
