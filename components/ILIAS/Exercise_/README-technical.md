## Repository Objects as Assignments

#### Step 1 [WIP]

- Provide an implementation of `ilExAssignmentTypeInterface` under Exercise/AssignmentTypes/classes (this should be decentralized in the future)
- Provide an implenetation of ilExAssignmentTypeGUIInterface under Exercise/AssignmentTypes/GUI/classes

In both cases you need to add your classes to the factory methods in `ilExAssignmentTypes` and `ilExAssignmentTypesGUI`.

#### Step 2 [WIP]

In your repository object use...
