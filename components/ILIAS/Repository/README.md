# Repository Service

This part of the documentation deals with concepts and business rules, for technical documentation see [README-technical.md](./README-technical.md).

## Trash

- To view the trash of a container class the "write" permission of the container is needed.
- To finally delete objects from a container trash, the "write" permission of the container is needed. Note: it is currently not possible to check permission on trashed objects.

## Recommended Content

- Recommended content is configured in the settings of a role. A content assigned to the roles of a user will be initially listed as recommended content on the dashboard. [1]
- Items are removed from the recommended content list, if they are selected as a favourite by the user. [1]
