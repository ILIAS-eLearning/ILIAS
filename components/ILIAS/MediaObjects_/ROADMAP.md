**Access Handling**

The fact that re-using media elements creates references that all allow write access to a media object if write access to the container is given sometimes confuses users and leads to undesired behaviour. However re-using (not simply copying all the time) media objects is a central use case in most larger content creation processes.

It would be possible to think of a more sophisticated access handling and for giving options (copy/reference) during copy processes. However this all would require some conceptual work.
