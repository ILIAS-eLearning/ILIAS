# Roadmap


## Short Term

### Multi-Lingual Support
The goal is to add multi-lingual support to the Administrative Notification module. This will allow for sending notifications in different languages.


## Mid Term

### Get rid of ActiveRecord and move to Repo-Pattern
The current implementation of the Administrative Notification is based on ActiveRecord. This is a legacy from the early days of the project. The current implementation is not very flexible and does not allow for easy extension. The goal is to move to a repository pattern. This will allow for a more flexible and extendable implementation and performance will be better.


## Long Term

### Full-Screen Notifications
The goal is to add a full-screen notification. This will allow for notifications which are displayed in the full-screen. This will be useful for notifications which are important for the user and should be visible more prominent.
