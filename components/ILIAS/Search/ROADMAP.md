# Roadmap

Note: Some of the rules listed in this roadmap may be superseded by general ILIAS rules in the future.

## Known Issues

- According to [1] files assigned to wikis or page objects are indexed but the index does not contain sufficient information (e.g subtype 'file', 'chapter', ...) to create an unambigous link the the respective object. 
- Currently, Polls can not be shown in search results since they are side
blocks without a functional ListGUI [2]. 

## Short Term


## Mid Term
- Add subtypes to lucene index and extend the search result xml accordingly. 

## Long Term
