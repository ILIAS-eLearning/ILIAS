# Roadmap

## Short Term

## Mid Term

### Improve Performance (and Privacy)

- Both Privacy and Performance would be improved, if old reservation data would be deleted regularly (e.g. via cron job).
- Similar the reservations in the future should be limited more restrictively (e.g. a setting to allow only up to x
  slots to be reserved, or only allow to reserve slots in the upcoming x months, with a hard maximum of 12 months).
