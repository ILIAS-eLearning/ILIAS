# Roadmap
- All the steps in this roadmap depend on the availability of funding for
refactoring.
- There are currently no new features on the roadmap.

## Short Term
- Apply Sustainability Package from PHP8-Refactoring
- Allow common settings to be accessed as Kitchensink-Forms. The previous access
ilPropertyForms will be depricated.

## Mid Term

### Further Refactoring
- Continue application of the Sustainability Package from PHP8-Refactoring
- Move all used UI-Elements to Kitchensink
- Removal of static methods
- Consolidation of ilObject and ilObject2 as well as ilObjectGUI and ilObject2GUI


## Long Term

### Refactoring and Restructuring
Work on a more encompasing refactoring of Services\Object will be started in
the short term, but it will take a while to produce results.
In the Long Term Services\Objects will be moved to a more collaborative maintenance
model. The refactoring aims to facilitate this and provide an easy to understand
Service.
