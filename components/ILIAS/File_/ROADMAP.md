# Roadmap


## Short Term

### Implement WOPI Interface
The Feature [Implement WOPI for File-Editing](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_7403_1357.html) will hopefully be implemented in the near future. This will allow for editing files in ILIAS using Office Online. The goal is to implement the WOPI Interface in the File module.

## Mid Term

### Remove all Public Methods which are used outside the Module
There are several other components which use the File Objects "as a service". This is not a good practice and should be avoided. The goal is to remove all public methods which are used outside the File module.


## Long Term

### Currently no long term goals
