     *      prompts for information without the user losing the current context.
     *      The Dialog is async by default and merely provides a wrapper,
     *      its contents are defined by the Dialog Response.
     *   composition: >

     *   effect: >
     *      The contents of Dialog are loaded asynchronously by default;
     *      actions of Forms and targets of Links are "wrapped" to RPCs and thus
     *      stay in context of the Dialog, i.e. you may take roundtrips to the
     *      server and modify the Dialog's content without closing it.

     *      asynchrounous requests in order to provide contents for a Dialog.
     *      It allows for dedicated changes to recurring parts of Dialogs,
     *      such as Title, Content or Buttons.
     *   composition: >
     *      The Dialog Response accepts Dialog Content to be handled by
     *      the Dialog.
     *   effect: >
     *       The sections of the Dialog Response are rendered to their respective
     *       parts of the Dialog.
     *       Forms and Links are automatically turned into async requests to
     *       stay in context of the Dialog.
     *       You may also tell the Dialog to close - after the request has been processed.
     * context:
