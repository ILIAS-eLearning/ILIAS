     *     The Progress Bar is designed to represent the state of a single or bundled task
     *     or process, which can be processed in a single step without further user interaction
     *     and takes a while to finish.
     *   composition: >
     *     The Progress Bar is composed out of one horizontal track, the area of which is
     *     filled according to the current progress (value). It is also accompanied by a label,
     *     describing the process/task at hand, and a Glyph to indicate a finished status
     *     (success or failure). An optional message can be displayed, to inform about a
     *     concrete status.
     *   effect: >
     *     When the Progress Bar value is updated, the filled area of the track changes
     *     accordingly.
     *     When the Progress Bar is finished, the Glyph changes to one indicating success or
     *     failure, and an according message will be shown.
     *   rivals:
     *     ProgressMeter: use a ProgressMeter if the quality of the progress is evaluated
     *     and/or the progress is compared.
     *     Workflow: use a Workflow component if the underlying process/task is completed
     *     in multiple steps that require further user interaction.

     * rules:
     *   usage:
     *     1: >
     *       The Progress Bar (value) SHOULD NOT be decreased. It should only be reset to 0, if
     *       the underlying process/task is restarted.
     *     2: >
     *       The Progress Bar SHOULD NOT be used, if the underlying process/task can only be
     *       0% or 100% processed. A loading animation and/or Glyph COULD be used instead.
     *   accessibility:
     *     1: >
     *       The Progress Bar must be fully understandable without any graphical UI.

     *     A State represents a particular version of a component at a specific time, which will be used
     *     to communicate with our client during asynchronous requests. The State conveys information in
     *     a manner that is understood by our clientside component, and provides the nesessary information
     *     to perform a desired change. We have been referring to this concept as "HTML over the wire" in
     *     the past, and are now implementing it for certain components in iterations.
     *   composition: >
     *     A State consist of HTML structures, typically other (or the same) UI component(s).
     *   effect: >
     *     When a State is rendered, it will be used by the clientside component to update the
     *     existing HTML structure according to the new State.
     *
     * rules:
     *   usage:
     *     1: You MUST NOT use a State outside of asynchronous requests.
     *     2: You MUST use @see Renderer::renderAsync() to render a State.
