     *      prompts for information without the user losing the current context.
     *      The Prompt is async by default and merely provides a wrapper,
     *      its contents are defined by the Prompt's State.
     *   composition: >

     *   effect: >
     *      The contents of Prompt are loaded asynchronously by default;
     *      actions of Forms and targets of Links are "wrapped" to RPCs and thus
     *      stay in context of the Prompt, i.e. you may take roundtrips to the
     *      server and modify the Prompt's content without closing it.
     * context:
     *   - The Prompt requires a Prompt State.

     *      asynchrounous requests in order to provide contents and commands
     *      for a Prompt.
     *      They allow for dedicated changes to recurring parts of Prompts,

     *      its respective parts.
     *   effect: >
     *       The sections of the Prompt State are rendered to their respective
     *       parts of the Prompt.
     *       Forms and Links are automatically turned into async requests to
     *       stay in context of the Prompt.
     *       You may also tell the Prompt to close or redirect - after the
     *       request has been processed.
