 *   ILIAS shows base progress meter with two bars with different percentages colored red and gray. A triangle marks the
 *   needed value at 80%. The information "Your Score 75%" and "80% Required Score" are positioned within the progress meter.
 *
 *   Changing the browser window's size will not change the size of the progress meter: the display stays the same!
