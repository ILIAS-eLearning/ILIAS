# Roadmap Static URL Service

## Short Term

### Replace all legacy _goto()-Methods in GUI-Classes with Handlers
This is probably a large part of simply moving code, but the modules can also directly offer new URLSs.

### Handler for services
E.g. for the dashboard, calendar etc. direct static URLs can be offered.

## Mid Term

### Remove iLink
Remove all method calls from ilLink, this can be done automatically with Rector if necessary.
