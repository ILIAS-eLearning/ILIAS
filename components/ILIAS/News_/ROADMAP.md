# News Roadmap

## Short Term

### News Read Information

ILIAS (still) stores, if a user has read an news item or not. The presentation of this status needs to be checked and the necessity of this feature should be discussed, since it is privacy related.

### Services Structure

The basic service structure needs a proper factory chain and a clearer data/repo/domain/gui separation.

## Mid Term

### Public News Handling

The way public automatically created news entries are handled in RSS feeds (no access check), is a constant source of misinterpretation, see e.g. #28803. This concept needs to be improved.
