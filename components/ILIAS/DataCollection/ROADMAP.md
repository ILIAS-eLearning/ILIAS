DataCollection Roadmap
======================

This document is a roadmap for the DataCollection module. It is a living document and will be updated as the module is developed.

## Short Term

### Formula parser in Refinery
As soon as we look at the topic of formula parsers again, we would like to check whether the calculation of formulas or parts of it could move into the refinery.

### UniTests for Formula parser
With the refactoring of the formula parser, we would like to create unit tests for the parser (which is now possible to test).

### Stack
we do not know if we really need the `\ILIAS\Modules\DataCollection\Fields\Formula\FormulaParser\Stack` or what is really the needed difference to a regular php-array.
