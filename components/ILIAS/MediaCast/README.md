# MediaCast

## Media Rendering

- See [MediaObjects/Readme](../MediaObjects/README.md) for information about how media is rendered in ILIAS in general.

## Videocast View

- Since release 8 ILIAS provides a dedicated view for video content, see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6210_1357.html
- Supported types are youtube, vimeo and mp4 files.
- Vimeo content must be public accessible.
- The **Autoplay** option allows to start subsequent videos as soon as the previous ends automatically. Note that this works best with local mp4 files and may have issues with external content.

## Podcast View

- Since release 8 ILIAS provides a dedicated view for audio content, see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6318_1357.html
- Supported type is mp3.

## Image Gallery View

- Since release 8 ILIAS provides a dedicated view for image content, see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6316_1357.html
- Supported types are png, jpeg and gif.
- If the learning progress is set to **Collection of Media Objects** the presentation will not provide the multi page lightbox. Every image has to be opened from the main view, to set the item to "completed".
