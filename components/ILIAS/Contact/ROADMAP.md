# Roadmap

## Short Term

## Mid Term

* There is currently no user action to initiate a contact
request in the `Who is online?` component, although such
an user action can be enabled in the global `Who is online?`
administration. There SHOULD be a concept of how such a user
action can be provided and how this action processed
(e.g. asynchronously).
