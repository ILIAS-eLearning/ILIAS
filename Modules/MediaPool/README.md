# Media Pool

## Business Rules

- The **write** permission allows to edit the settings and the content.
- To **re-use** a media pool in another repository object (e.g. a learning module), the **write** permission to the pool is needed. This is due to the fact, that re-use means creating a new reference to the media object and all references currently give the full edit access to a media object, see [README.md of Media Object service](../../Services/MediaObjects/README.md)
- The upload directory path (admins only) is `<client-data-dir>/upload/mob`.
