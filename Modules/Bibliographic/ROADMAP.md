# Roadmap


## Short Term

### Currently no short term goals


## Mid Term

### Remove outdated library `technosophos/libris`
The Library technosophos/libris is outdated and not maintained anymore. The goal is to remove it and replace it with a more modern library or write our own.


## Long Term

### Get rid of ActiveRecord and move to Repo-Pattern
The current implementation of the Bibliographic module is based on ActiveRecord. This is a legacy from the early days of the project. The current implementation is not very flexible and does not allow for easy extension. The goal is to move to a repository pattern. This will allow for a more flexible and extendable implementation and performance will be better.
