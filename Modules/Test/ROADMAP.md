# Roadmap

Priorities for the development of the Test & Assessment and the Test Question Pool depend on developer resources provided by a handfull of organizations. Thus no promises are made on timeframes.

## Prioritized
* Reducing the number of reported issues in Test & Assessment
* Defining a concise interface for questions.
* Separating the Test-Player from the Questions and the Question-Pool.

## Others
* Fixing access to Learning Status when access to test results is limited (see: [Mantis 25064](https://mantis.ilias.de/view.php?id=25064&nbn=9))

## Kiosk-Mode
* current kiosk-mode enforces the header to be removed without it (the header) being a UI-Component. 
* In consequence, a test_kiosk_header.css is neccessary to hide whitespace (https://mantis.ilias.de/view.php?id=36161)
* This SHOULD be removed in favor of a concept with better integration.

## Open Warnings / Issues without Tickets
These are open findings from the PHP8 Project which couldn't be solved in the scope of the project itself. They are documented here for transparency.
