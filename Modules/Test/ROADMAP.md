# Roadmap

Priorities for the development of the Test & Assessment and the Test Question Pool depend on developer resources provided by a handfull of organizations. Thus no promises are made on timeframes.

## Prioritized
* Reducing the number of reported issues in Test & Assessment
* Defining a concise interface for questions.
* Separating the Test-Player from the Questions and the Question-Pool.

## Others
* Fixing access to Learning Status when access to test results is limited (see: [Mantis 25064](https://mantis.ilias.de/view.php?id=25064&nbn=9))
