# Course

This documentation is a work in progress, and will be updated with
more information.

### Certificates

If the Learning Progress is globally activated, then Course Certificates
will only be issued to users via their Learning Progress status: when
a user achieves the status 'Completed', they will recieve a Certificate.
This is handled automatically by `Services/Certificate`.

If the Learning Progress is globally deactivated, Courses will instead issue
Certificates to users when their status in the Course is set to 'Passed'.
