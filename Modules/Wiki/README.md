# Wiki

## Business Rules

### Print View

- The print process uses a modal to select the printed pages, see https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6995_1357.html
- The print view opens in a separate tab, see https://mantis.ilias.de/view.php?id=20653

### Notifications

- Notifications can be activated for the whole wiki or for single wiki pages.
- After a notification for a page change has been sent, ILIAS does not sent additional notifications for the same page for the next 3 hours (standard waiting time in notification service).
