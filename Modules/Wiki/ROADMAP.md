# Roadmap

## Short Term

### Mediawiki code

The mediawiki code (`mediawiki/Title.php` and `ilWikiUtil`) is currently more or less "untouched". It should be put under unit tests and integrated in our code. Unused parts should be removed.

### Service Architecture

A cleaner separation of data, repository, domain and GUI code should be introduced.
