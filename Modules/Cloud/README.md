- By updating to ILIAS 8 no data of existing Cloud Objects will be deleted, to make a later migration e.g. to a plugin possible.
- Existing Cloud objects can only be deleted. It will not perform any other action with it.
- A migration is available for ILIAS 8 to permanently delete all existing cloud objects in the repository.

For ILIAS 9:
