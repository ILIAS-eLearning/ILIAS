# Requirement

A prerequisite for the chat server is Node.js. The chat server is tested with the following versions of Node.js:

* 8.9.4 (LTS)
* 9.7.1


The latest version can be downloaded at the following URL: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall

In addition, [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#deb "here") is an installation guide for the respective Unix-based operating system.


The basic configuration is done within ILIAS in the section `Administration / Chat`. After the server and client settings have been saved, the configuration files `server.cfg` and` client.cfg` are stored in the external ILIAS data directory in the subdirectory `chatroom`. These files MUST be passed to start the Chat Server (see [Server Configuration](#Server Configuration)).

![](./docu/images/view-clientsettings_en.PNG)

**Note:** On all changes to the settings, the chat server MUST be restarted!

## ILIAS Configuration

### Chat Server Settings

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_adress_en.PNG)


#### IP address / FQDN
The IPv4 address or FQDN where the chat server is to be bound.

Example:

* `chat.myilias.de`
* `192.168.1.1`

#### Port

The port on which the chat server is to be bound.

Example:

* `8888`

#### Relative Path

This configuration section is only needed if the chat server is not running directly below the ILIAS document root directory and the chat server URL looks like this: `http (s): // [IP / DOMAIN] / [PATH] / [TO] / [CHAT] `. For some technical requirements it MAY be necessary to use the relative path.

Examples:


* `https://myilias.de/servers/chat` (relative path: "/servers/chat")
* `https: // myilias.de` (relative path: [leave field empty])

#### Protokoll

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_protocol_en.PNG)


* **HTTP**: There is an unencrypted communication over HTTP with the chat server.

* **HTTPS**: There is SSL encrypted communication over HTTP with the chat server. The following settings are necessary.
  *   Certificate: absolute server path to the SSL certificate (for example: `/ etc / ssl / certs / server.pem`).
  *   Key: absolute server path to the private key (eg: * `/ etc / ssl / private / server.key`).
  *   Diffie-Hellman parameter: absolute server path to Diffie-Hellman file (eg: `/ etc / ssl / private / dhparam.pem`),
  *   Diffie-Hellman parameter creation (e.g., generated via: `openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/private/dhparam.pem 2048`).

#### Logging

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_log_en.PNG)


The paths for the chat server log and the error log can be specified OPTIONALLY.

*  Chat server log file: Absolute server path to the log file (eg `/var/www/ilias/data/chat.log`), into which the chat server logs general events.
*  Chat server error log file: Absolute server path to the error log file (for example, `/var/www/ilias/data/chat_errors.log`), into which the chat server logs errors.

If no paths are defined, the chat server creates the log file in the chat server directory.

#### Connection ILIAS to the server

By default, ILIAS uses the IP address or FQDN set in the server configuration. It is recommended that the chat server is only locally accessible and made publicly available through a proxy server. In this case, another URL MUST be specified, via which the client can connect to the chat server.

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_ilias_proxy_en.PNG)

**Note:** It is possible to specify the URL with and without protocol definition. If no protocol is specified, the protocol definition setting for the URL will be used.

#### Connection client to the server

See [Connection ILIAS to Server](#connection-ilias-to-server) this is the connection the browser (client) uses to the chat server. The URL MUST be reachable by all browser clients.

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_client_proxy_en.PNG)

#### Delete old messages

The deletion of old messages can be activated by selecting a ***Interval***. After this interval, all past messages are deleted, depending on the configured threshold. Both messages from the repository chat and from the on-screen chats are deleted.

![](./docu/images/view-serversettings_deletion_mode_en.PNG)


### General Settings

![](./docu/images/view-clientsettings_en.PNG)

#### Enable chat

The chat can be activated or deactivated via the selection field.

#### Repository Chat: Enable on-screen notifications

If enabled, users will be informed by a pop-up about new invitations in repository chats.

![](./docu/images/view-clientsettings_enable_osd_en.PNG)

**Note**: Less time allows more timely notifications, but increases server load.

#### Name and Authentication

To establish a connection between an ILIAS client and a chat server,
a unique name MUST be defined in the ILIAS client. It is imperative that each name is unique within a chat server instance.

In order to protect the chat server against unauthorized access, a key pair for the ***authentication*** MUST be generated for each client.

Example:

* Authentication Key = 801c4a44-739a-45d8-93df-880e7a2ac8e7
* Authentication Secret = 04e60a6e-e9e7-4eb7-bd01-96e65b9a767c

## Server configuration

If the chat server is to be run in a different directory, the entire ILIAS chat directory (`ILIAS / Modules / Chatroom / chat`) MUST be copied to the desired directory.

**Note**: The following configuration files are generated in ILIAS (see - [ILIAS Configuration](#ilias configuration)). These MUST be copied again when changing the configuration in ILIAS!

The two configuration files `server.cfg` and` client.cfg` can be found in the path `[PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY] / [ANY_CLIENT_ID] / chatroom`.

server.cfg:
```json
{
    "protocol": "http",
    "port": "8888",
    "address": "chat.myilias.de",
    "cert": "",
    "key": "",
    "dhparam": "",
    "log": "\/var\/www\/ilias\/data\/chat.log",
    "error_log": "\/var\/www\/ilias\/data\/chat_errors.log",
    "sub_directory": "",
    "deletion_mode": "1",
    "deletion_unit": "month",
    "deletion_value": "3",
    "deletion_time": "03:00"
}
```


client.cfg:
```json
{
    "name": "onscreen",
    "enable_osd": false,
    "enable_osc": true,
    "osd_intervall": 60,
    "chat_enabled": true,
    "enable_smilies": true,
    "play_invitation_sound": false,
    "auth": {
    "key": "0cdc8989-d5f0-1111-4444-244320d9dabc",
    "secret": "f7471a0e-c454-2222-3333-bb0f1b5d4123"
    },
    "database": {
        "type": "mysql",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 3306,
        "name": "ilias_db",
        "user": "dbuser",
        "pass": "geheim"
    }
}
```
### Single ILIAS client:

The following is the command to start a chat server for a single client.

```bash
cd [ILIAS_ROOT_DIRECTORY]
node Modules/Chatroom/chat/chat [PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY]/[CLIENT_ID]/chatroom/server.cfg [PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_VERZEICHNIS]/[CLIENT_ID]/chatroom/client.cfg &
```



### Multiple ILIAS clients:

The following shows the command that can be used to start a multi-client chat server.

```bash
cd [ILIAS_ROOT_DIRECTORY]
node Modules/Chatroom/chat/chat [PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY]/[ANY_CLIENT_ID]/chatroom/server.cfg [PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY]/[CLIENT_ID_1]/chatroom/client.cfg [PATH_TO_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIRECTORY]/[CLIENT_ID_2]/chatroom/client.cfg ... &
```
Whether the chat server is running can be checked with the command ***netstat***. In the output, the service SHOULD be displayed with the specified ip:port.

```bash
netstat -tlpn
```

In addition, the function can be checked via the following URL. If successful, the status code **200** will be returned.

```bash
curl http(s)://myilas.de/backend/Heartbeat/onscreen

{
  "status": 200
}
```

## Start the chat server automatically

On Unix-based operating systems, there are various systems for managing services, e.g. SysVinit, systemd, etc.

### systemd (ubuntu)

To automatically start the chat server with systemd, a file is stored in `/ etc / systemd / system`. chat.myilias.service created with the following content.

**Note:** The paths MUST be adjusted accordingly. For multiple clients, unique names MUST be assigned to the client.cfg, e.g. a_client.cfg, b_client.cfg, etc.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ILIAS onscreenchat
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/environment
Type=simple
User=onscreenchat
Group=onscreenchat
WorkingDirectory=/%path%/%to%/%onscreenchat%
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "/usr/bin/node /%path%/%to%/%onscreenchat%/chat.js /%path%/%to%/%onscreenchat%/server.cfg /%path%/%to%/%onscreenchat%/%allclient%/*_client.cfg"
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Proxy configuration

It is recommended to make the chat server publicly available only through a proxy server.
This section describes how to use such a proxy server with `nginx` or` Apache2`.

### Proxy configuration via nginx

Global configuration:

    proxy_set_header   Upgrade          $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   Connection       $connection_upgrade;

    # we're in the http context here
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }


vHost Configuration:

    upstream onscreenchat  {
        server      127.0.0.1:8888;
        keepalive   16;
    }

    location ~ ^/(chat|socket.io|backend) {
            proxy_pass         http://onscreenchat;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_buffering off;
            access_log  /var/log/nginx/onscreenchat.access.log ;
    }


In the ILIAS configuration the proxy configurations are adjusted in the ***Chatserver settings***.

Example:

    https://onscreenchat.domain.de


### Proxy configuration via apache2

The configuration takes place in the Apache default configuration or in the corresponding vHost. In addition, the following Apache modules are REQUIRED:
proxy, proxy_connect, proxy_html, proxy_http, proxy_wstunnel, xml2enc

    ProxyPassMatch backend/(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:8888/$0
    ProxyPassMatch ^chat/(.*)$   http://127.0.0.1:8888/$0

    RewriteEngine On
         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/socket.io/           [NC]
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket               [NC]
        RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://127.0.0.1:8888/$1  [P]

        RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=polling       [NC]
        RewriteRule /(.*)           http://127.0.0.1:8888/$1 [P]

In the ILIAS configuration the proxy configurations are adjusted in the ***Chat server settings***.

Example:

    https://onscreenchat.domain.de
