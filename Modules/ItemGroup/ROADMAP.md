# Roadmap


## Short Term

## Mid Term

### Moving to KS / Enabling Keyboard Control

Like other parts of the repository views, the presentation of item groups should be migrated to KS components. One important open issue is the keyboard control of expandable item groups, which is currently not possible, due to the DIV being used for the group header, see also https://mantis.ilias.de/view.php?id=35988 

### Sessions in Item Groups

There is a strong need to support this. See business rules in the README.

### Improve Architecture

- Use Service/ classes to...
- Introduce repository pattern
- Improve DI handling
- Factor business logic out of UI classes
