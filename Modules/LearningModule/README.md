# Learning Modules

## Copy Process

- When pages, chapters or learning modules are copied, the media objects are re-used. This means that all instances will refer to the same shared object. This prevents large media files from to filling up disk space quickly.
- Questions will be not shared when pages are copied. Every page copy will get separate copies of a question.

## Reading Time
- The estimated reading time is language independent and always derived from the master language. (https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_6586_1357.html)
