# Learning Modules

## Copy Process

### Business Rules

- When pages, chapters or learning modules are copied, the media objects are re-used. This means that all instances will refer to the same shared object. This prevents large media files from to filling up disk space quickly.
- Questions will be not shared when pages are copied. Every page copy will get separate copies of a question.
