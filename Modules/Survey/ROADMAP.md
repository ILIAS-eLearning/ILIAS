### Refactoring of Constraint Handling

- Constraints for questions blocks are currently working, if the are internally assigned to the first question of the block (see README). This is error prone, e.g. adding a question at the end of a block will keep the constraint, adding a question on the front will remove the constraint. The constraint handling should be refactored.
