## Overview

* A **Survey Question Pool** enables authoring of questions. Questions of pools can be reused in Surveys.
* A **Question** has a certain **Question Type**. Current Types are: Singel Choice, Multiple Choice, Metric, Matrix and Test.
* A **Question Category** is a general answer option of a question.
* A **Phrase** is a predefined set of answer options, which can be re-used during question editing.
* A **Variable** is an answer option of a concrete question (referencing a category and a question).
* A **Survey** contains a number of **Survey Questions** that are asked to participants.
* A **Question Block** groups multiple questions on one page. 
* A **Constraint** uses a relation and scale value (e.g. >1) to define a conditional presentation of questions.
* A **Question Constraint** imposes a constraint on a question of the survey.
* A **Survey Run** represents the current state of a user progress during a survey (access to pages, finished state)
* An **Answer** represents an answer given by a user during a Survey Run.
* A **Invitation** invites a user to participate in a survey by adding a task to his/her task list.


## Survey Question Pool
* **Code**: `Modules/SurveyQuestinoPool`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_qpl`

### Properties

* **Property**: ... (`table.column`)

### Business Rules

...


## Questions
* **Code**: `Modules/SurveyQuestinoPool/Questions`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_question`

### Properties
* **Question Type**:  (`svy_question.questiontype_fi`)
* **Pool or Survey**: Object ID of parent Pool or Survey (`svy_question.obj_fi`)
* **Author**: Object ID of author user (`svy_question.owner_fi`)
* : 1 or 0 depending if the user saved any data (`svy_question.complete`)
* : (`svy_question.original_id`)
* ...
  
### Issues
* If we do not save any answer and press "back to de Survey" or we leave this page without save. In the "svy_question" we have the records "title" and "questiontext" with NULL values and also "complete" and "tstamp" with value 0  (Look for services/cron which delete this rows).

## Question Type
* **Code**: `Modules/SurveyQuestinoPool/Questions`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_qtype`

Can we get rid of legacy plugin architecture?
Can we get of the table completely?

## Question Category
A question category is an answer option of a question. There are predefined answer options, and custom options which are created during question editing.
* **Code**: `Modules/SurveyQuestinoPool/Categories`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_category`

[WIP]
* Categories are reused by all questions, depending on the category title (answer option text)
* If a question is edited and a category title (answer option) already exists, it
  will be assigned to the question
* class ilSurveyCategory represents single category (but also holds "variable" data)
  * title ("answer option text")
  * other (if true, an additional text input field presented for free user input is presented)
  * neutral (true: this is a neutral answer, ...)
  * label ...
  * scale (<- this will be stored in "Variables")
* class SurveyCategories handles an array of ilSurveyCategory objects (for a question)
* problem: neither ilSurveyCategory nor SurveyCategories writes into table svy_category this is done by
  classes SurveySingleChoiceQuestion, SurveyQuesiton, SurveyMatrixQuestion and SurveyPhrases, ...
* table svy_category
  * title: answer text
  * defaultvalue: is set to "1" for categories predefined by the system? or for user defined phrases
  * neutral:
  * ..
  
## Phrases
* **Code**: `Modules/SurveyQuestinoPool/Phrases`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_phrase`,`svy_phrase_cat`

[WIP]
* Reusable sets of answer options (only for single choice and matrix questions) 
* table svy_phrase
    * title (of the answer option set/phrase)
    * defaultvalue...
* table svy_phrase_cat (Answer options of phrase)
  * phrase_fi -> phrase in svy_phrase
  * category_fi -> general answer option in svy_category
  * sequence: order of the options in the question presentation
  * other:
  * scale: always NULL?, editing provides only disabled input fields
* problem: why scale field when always NULL?


## Variables
* **Code**: 
* **DB Tables**: `svy_variable`



[WIP]
* Answer options for each question
* Hold Scale Values
* table svy_variable
  * category_fi: general answer option -> svy_category
  * question_fi: question -> svy_question
  * value1: for metric q: min value
  * value2: for metric q: max value
  * sequence: order of the options in the question presentation
  * other:
  * scale: scale value (positives or NULL. Here the scale have the real value entered, not scale -1 )
* problem: value1/value2 values seem to be redundant or belong to other tables (e.g. metric)


## Question Editing
* Question GUI classes 
  * Save process: save() -> saveForm() -> importEditFormValues() -> question object saveToDb()
  

## Survey
* **Code**: `Modules/Survey`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_svy`

### Properties

* **Survey ID**: Surveys have their own IDs (`svy_svy.survey_id`) and additionally reference the Object ID (`svy_svy.obj_fi`).
* ...
* **Privacy**: With Names (0): Names are presented in the Participants and Results view. Without Names/Anonymous (2): Instead of the names the term "Anonymous" is printed out in the Participants and Results view. (`svy_svy.anonymize`, see Property Access Codes)
* **List of Participants**: This suboption of Privacy/Anonymous is only available if activated in the Administration (List of Participants). This activates an additional Participants list with first-, lastname, login and status (finished) after the end date of the survey. Additionally a minimum number of participants can be set in the Administration (`svy_svy.anon_user_list`).
* **Access Codes**: Use Access Codes yes/no (`svy_svy.anonymize`: 0: With Names/No Codes, 1: Anonymous/Codes, 2: Anonymous/No Codes, 3: With Names/Codes). If activated, all users have to enter an access code when starting the survey.


[WIP]
* table svy_svy (general settings of the survey)
  * obj_fi: general object -> object_data
  * ...

## Survey Questions
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_svy_qst`,`svy_qst_oblig`

[WIP]
* table svy_svy_qst
  * survey_fi: survey -> svy_svy
  * question_fi: question -> svy_question
  * sequence: ordering of the questions in the survey (increments +1 normally through question blocks)
  * ...
* table svy_qst_oblig (compulsory (obligatory/mandatory) property)
  * survey_fi: survey -> svy_svy
  * question_fi: question -> svy_question
  * obligatory: 1 for true
* problem: Why is this not a simple property in svy_svy_qst?
  
## Question Block
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_qblk`, `svy_qblk_qst`

[WIP]
* table svy_qblk
  * title: block title
  * show_questiontext: enables to show/hide question texts for questions of the block
  * show_blocktitle: show/hide title of the block in presentation
* table svy_qblk_qst (Questions of a question block)
  * survey_fi: survey -> svy_svy
  * question_fi: question -> svy_question (could have pointed to svy_svy_qst instead, but does not do)
  * question_block_fi: block -> svy_qblk
  
## Constraints
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_relation`, `svy_constraint`

General Idea: Conditional presentation of questions or question blocks (pages) depending on former answers. Constraints can be defined using single choice, multiple choice and metric questions.

[WIP]
* table svy_relation (<, <=, =>, ..., fixed set of relations, should be moved from table to class constants)
  * longname, e.g. less
  * shortname, e.g. <
  * problem: why storing this in a table, its static?
* table svy_constraint
  * question_fi: "source" question -> svy_question
  * relation_fi: relation -> svy_relation
  * value: scale value - 1 !?
  * conjunction: or/and (but why on this level?)

## Question Constraint
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_qst_constraint`

If the constraint is met, show the question.

[WIP]
* table svy_qst_constraint 
  * survey_fi: survey -> svy_svy
  * question_fi: "target" question -> svy_question
  * constraint_fi: constraint definition -> svy_constraint
* problem: it seems that svy_constraint and svy_qst_constraint could be merged into one table

## Survey Run
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_finished`,`svy_times`

[WIP]
* table svy_finished (progress of user)
  * finished_id: autoincrement and pk of this table
  * survey_fi: survey -> svy_svy
  * user_fi: user -> usr_data (and object_data)
  * anonymous_id:
  * state: 1 if finished? 0 otherwise?
  * lastpage:
  * appr_id:
* table svy_times (Access times to survey pages during a run. Back and forward navigation lead to multiple entries per run for a page)
  * finished_fi: survey run -> svy_finished
  * first_question: first question id of page/block -> svy_question (does not seem to point to svy_svy_qst)
  * entered_page: timestamp when page has been rendered
  * left_page: timestamp when answers of page have been saved
  
## Answer
* **Code**:
* **DB Tables**: `svy_answer`

[WIP]
* Given answers by user during test run, mc question answers may lead to multiple entries for one question in a run
* table svy_answer
  * active_fi: survey run -> svy_finished
  * question_fi: question -> svy_question (does not point to svy_svy_qst)
  * value: scale value of corresponding "variable" -1?
  * textanswer: 
  * rowvalue:
  
## Invitation
* **Code**: `Modules/Survey/Participants`
* **DB Tables**: `svy_invitation`

### Properties
* **User**: (`svy_invitation.user_id`)
* **Survey**: (`svy_invitation.survey_id`)
