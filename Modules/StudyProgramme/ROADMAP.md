# ilObjStudyProgrammeSettingsGUI

* The settings form currently performs side effects in the transformation of the
form. This is not allowed and thus needs to be removed. We could use the data objects
from the models instead and simply set a new settings object to the programme object. 
* Remove inline html from GUI's.
* Replace the default -1 value with null in prg_sttings
* Refactoring of DIC. Split in multiple DIC with object or without. Perhaps it is possible to switch to trait
* Remove all setObject and getObject Methods in classes
* Refactoring subtab structure for settings

# ilStudyProgrammeDashboardViewGUI
* adjust dashboard to use current_progress and its functions instead of 
re-implementing isCompleted/isInProgress


# ilStudyProgrammeIndividualPlanTableGUI
* fetchData passes a _reference_ to $plan into applyToSubTreeNodes; this
is quite implicit and might be amended by a catamorphic "requestFromSubTreeNodes"?!

# Construction of ilStudyProgrammeAssignment and ilStudyProgrammeProgress
* "Correctness by Construction": The properies should go in the constructor of
the classes; maybe we can also get rid of one or the other mutator?

# Assignment/Progress
There are properties on assignment/progress, that look like misconceptions and should move.
Careful: This also means migrating!
* Deadline and validity or qualification both belong to Assignment (not Progress)
* Relevant/Irrelevant is not a status, but a separate flag.
* "Completion of Assignment/Qualification" means: progress at root-node is successful.
* "Individual" rather belongs to Assignemnt and says: there are modifications to progresses
in terms of points or relevance. This is not a static flag but a result of querying progresses.
