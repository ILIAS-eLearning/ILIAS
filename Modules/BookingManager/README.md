# Booking Manager

## Public Service
### Using Booking Manager in Repository Objects

It is possible to integrate the booking manager as a service into other repository objects, see corresponding [feature wiki entry](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_5722_1357.html).

Currently additional features are organised by **ilObjectServiceSettingsGUI**. You need to integrate this into your settings form initialisation and update procedure:

```
ilObjectServiceSettingsGUI::initServiceSettingsForm(
	$this->object->getId(),
	$form,
	array(
	[...],
		ilObjectServiceSettingsGUI::BOOKING
	)
);
```

```
// after $form initialisation
...
ilObjectServiceSettingsGUI::updateServiceSettingsForm(
	$this->object->getId(),
	$form,
	array(
		[...],
		ilObjectServiceSettingsGUI::BOOKING
	)
);
```


Furthermore you need to add a **tab** to your UI which points to the class ilBookingGatewayGUI:

```
$tabs->addTab("booking", $lng->txt("..."),
	$ctrl->getLinkTargetByClass(array("ilbookinggatewaygui"), ""));
```

The same class needs to be integrated in your **executeCommand** control flow:

```
* @ilCtrl_Calls ilYourClassGUI: ilBookingGatewayGUI
```

```
function executeCommand()
{
	...
	$next_class = $this->ctrl->getNextClass($this);
	switch($next_class)
	{
		case "ilbookinggatewaygui":
			...
			$gui = new ilBookingGatewayGUI($this);
			$this->ctrl->forwardCommand($gui);
			break;
	...
```

It is possible to **use the booking manager in a sub-context**, e.g. in a session of a course. The pool selection should only be offered in the course and the session derives these settings from the course. In this case you have to provide the master host ref id (e.g. the course ref id), when creating the instance of ilBookingGatewayGUI within the sub-context (session), e.g.:

```
function executeCommand()
{
	...
	$next_class = $this->ctrl->getNextClass($this);
	switch($next_class)
	{
		case "ilbookinggatewaygui":
			...
			// example: in ilObjSessionGUI we provide the course ref id
			// to define the course as the master host, which also defines the booking
			// pools being used
			$gui = new ilBookingGatewayGUI($this, $course_ref_id);
			$this->ctrl->forwardCommand($gui);
			break;
	...
```

If your repository objects should present the booking information on the **info screen**, add:

```
$info = new ilInfoScreenGUI($this);
$info->enableBookingInfo(true);
```

## Internal Documentation

This section documents the general concepts and structures of the Booking Manager. These are internal implementations which SHOULD not be used outside of this module unless mentioned in the **Public Service** section of this README.

* [Booking Objects](#booking-objects)
* [Reservations](#reservations)
* [Participants](#participants)


### Overview

* A **booking pool** is a repository object that manages resources (booking objects) and their usage (reservations). There are two main types: Pools that are using schedules (e.g. for booking rooms) and pools without schedules (e.g. for booking term paper topics).
* A pool can hold multiple **schedules**. Schedules contain a set of weekly time **slots** where bookings for objects can be made, e.g. "Monday 10:00-11:00".
* A pool manages multiple **booking objects** (resources), e.g. a room or a set of beamers. A booking object uses either no schedule (depending on the pool type) or exactly one schedule.
* Users can make **reservations** for booking objects on specific dates that correspond to a time slot of the schedule attached to the booking object.
* Users that make reservations in a pool are called **participants**. It is also possible to manually add participants to the pool, that did not make any reservations yet.

### Booking Pool

A booking pool is the main entity for managing booking objects (resources) and their usage (reservations).

* **Code**: `Modules/BookingManager`
* **DB Tables**: `booking_settings`

#### Properties

* **Fixed Schedule** or **No Schedule**: There are two main types of booking pools, those which are using schedules (e.g. for booking rooms) and those who don't (e.g. for selection of term paper topics). (`booking_settings.schedule_type`)
* **Public Reservations**: The list of reservations can be made publicly available for all users with read permission. (`booking_settings.public_log`)
* **Overall Limit of Bookings** (No schedule only): Limits the maximum number of bookings a single user can do in this pool. (`booking_settings.ovlimit`)
* **Default Period for Reservation List** (Fixed schedule only): Sets the default period of the filter in the reservation list view. (`booking_settings.rsv_filter_period`)
* **Reminder**: A reminder can be activated (`booking_settings.reminder_status`) to remind users of their upcoming bookings. The period before users are reminded can be set (`booking_settings.reminder_day`). A cronjob stores the timestamp for last execution (`booking_settings.last_remind_ts`).

*Deprecated*

* `booking_settings.slots_no` ?

### Schedules

* **Code**: `Modules/BookingManager/Schedule`
* **DB Tables**: `booking_schedule`, `booking_schedule_slot`

#### Properties

...

### Booking Objects

* **Code**: `Modules/BookingManager/Objects`
* **DB Tables**: `booking_objects`

#### Properties

...

### Reservations

* **Code**: `Modules/BookingManager/Reservations`
* **DB Tables**: `booking_reservation`

#### Properties

* **User**: User who 'owns' the reservation. (`booking_reservation.user`)
* **Assigner**: User who created the reservation. A tutor (assigner) may assign a reservation to a student (user who owns the reservation). (`booking_reservation.assigner_id`)
* **Object**: Object that is reserved. (`booking_reservation.object_id`) 
* **Reservation Period**: Timestamps that correspond to a concrete instance of a slot of the object schedule. (`booking_reservation.date_from`, `booking_reservation.date_to`)
* **Reservation Status**: Currently `NULL` (reserved) or `ilBookingReservation::STATUS_CANCELLED` (reservation cancelled). (`booking_reservation.status`)
* **Reservation Grouping**: If multiple instances of an object are reserved, each of them will get an entry in the reservation table. They will all share the same internal group ID. (`booking_reservation.group_id`)
* **Context Object**: If a reservation is done within another repository object (e.g. course), this is stored with the reservation. (`booking_reservation.context_obj_id`)

### Participants

* **Code**: `Modules/BookingManager/Participants`
* **DB Tables**: `booking_member`

### Business Rules

#### Assignment by Preferences

**Procedure**

See https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_5688_1357.html

Phase A

* Calcualte the popularity p(t) of each topic (number of users u that have choosen a topic)
* Choose topic t with lowest p(t); where p(t) > 0 (most unpopular topic)
* Randomly choose user u who has t as preference
* remove user and topic from list, start from the beginning

Phase B (only remaining users with no valid options)

* Choose random remaining user u
* Calculate number of assignments for each topic a(t)
* Assign t with minimum a(t) to u
* remove user and topic from list, start from the beginning
