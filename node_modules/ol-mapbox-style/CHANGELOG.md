### Breaking changes

#### Module paths

ol-mapbox-style now ships with transpiled modules in the `dist/` folder, and sources in the `src/` folder. Previously, all modules were provided in the root directory.

When upgrading, the import paths need to be checked. For example,
```js
import stylefunction from 'ol-mapbox-style/stylefunction';
```
needs to be changed to
```js
import stylefunction from 'ol-mapbox-style/dist/stylefunction';
```

### Other changes

## 4.0.0

### Breaking changes

#### Zoom handling

The way how we handle `zoom`, `minzoom` and `maxzoom` throughout the library has been reworked:

* When ol-mapbox-style creates an `ol/View` instance, it will be configured with the zoom level range that mapbox-gl uses. When updating from previous versions, you will notice that the zoom levels of the OpenLayers view will now match those in the Mapbox Style object. Previously OpenLayers zoom levels were higher by 1.
* When a Mapbox Style object is configured with a `zoom`, the zoom level will now be interpreted like in mapbox-gl, i.e. you will be zoomed in one level deeper than before the update.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on a Mapbox Style layer were previously determined by the tile size of the underlying source. For raster sources with a tile size of 256, this means that `minzoom` and `maxzoom` are zoomed in one level deeper than before the update. For sources with a tile size of 512, nothing changes.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on a Mapbox Style source now influence the `ol/tilegrid/TileGrid` that ol-mapbox-style creates for a source in a different way. The resolutions will always match mapbox-gl default zoom levels.
* `minzoom` and `maxzoom` on Mapbox Style layers no longer  influences whether the `ol/layer/Layer` instance is  set `visible` at a certain resolution. Instead, the layer's `maxResolution` and `minResolution` are set.

### Switch to the ol package

With version 2.x, ol-mapbox-style switched to the [`ol`](https://npmjs.com/package/ol) npm package for the OpenLayers dependency. Users of `dist/olms.js` will not notice this change. Applications that have been using the [`openlayers`](https://npmjs.com/package/openlayers) npm package should be migrated to the `ol` package too.

If switching to `ol` is not yet desired, it is still possible to use ol-mapbox-style with the `openlayers` package, with the help of [`standalonify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standalonify). You have to require OpenLayers as `global.ol = require('openlayers');`. To build the bundle, use a command like the following:

``` sh
$ node_modules/.bin/browserify -g [ babelify --plugins [ transform-es2015-modules-commonjs ] ]  -p [ standalonify --name null --deps [ null --ol/style/style ol.style.Style --ol/style/fill ol.style.Fill --ol/style/stroke ol.style.Stroke --ol/style/circle ol.style.Circle --ol/style/icon ol.style.Icon --ol/style/text ol.style.Text ] ] example/index.js > example/bundle.js
```

### `getStyleFunction` moved to separate mapbox-to-ol-style package

For applications that do not need sprites and web fonts for their styles, a separate [`mapbox-to-ol-style`](https://npmjs.com/package/mapbox-to-ol-style) package with focus on small build size and minimal dependencies has been created. ol-mapbox-style depends on that package.

If you have previously been using the `getStyleFunction` function, you now have to import it from `mapbox-to-ol-style`. If you have not used anything else from ol-mapbox-style, you can uninstall it.

### Google fonts no longer need to be included in the html

ol-mapbox-style now automatically loads web fonts from Google. So in most cases, it is no longer necessary to scan the Mapbox Style for fonts and include them manually in the html of the application.
