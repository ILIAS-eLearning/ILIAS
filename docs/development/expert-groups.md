# Experts Groups

**Expert Groups support the ILIAS community in improving quality aspects in the
fields of usability, performance, security, software architecture and the
development process.** These cross cutting concerns are the responsibility of
the Technical Board, as assigned by the by-laws of the ILIAS society. Still,
these fields cannot be treated effectively by the Technical Board alone but
need broad consideration in all stages of the development process. The expert
groups are meant to help the community and the Technical Board by providing
knowledge and insights in various forms.

To do that, **the groups will work on any means that serve the goal to improve
quality e.g. consultancy, tools, code, concepts, documentation, guideline, process
definitions.** Depending on the field, the state of the art in that field and the
problem at hand, different approaches for improvements may be conceivable. The
expert group are expected to identify and propose means that are effective,
efficient and appropriate.

To implement them, **the experts use existing processes for decision making, e.g.
the Jour Fixe**, if required. They are also expected to use other processes and
tools provided by the ILIAS community, such as the Mantis Issue Tracker, GitHub,
the ILIAS conference and the development conference. The experts should convince
other community members by tangible reasoning, just as other community members.

To indicate a special trust of the TB, the **expert groups are appointed by the
Technical Board**. This also gives the experts a special visibility in the
community. **The members of the experts groups are appointed for their well-founded
knowledge in the respective field**. They all are willing and able to
contribute and share that knowledge. **All members of expert groups will be listed
publicly.** The TB is looking to include all people with the required expertise
and the willingness to contribute. **Membership applications can be handed in to
the various expert groups. The Technical Board will confirm memberships and ensure
the general working capacity of the groups.**

The TB expects the experts to contribute their insights, opinions and criticism
as early as possible in the development process. Also, the TB expects all community
members to seak the experts advice and listen to their feedback. **The Technical
Board is committed to make the experts opinions heard in the development of ILIAS.
Recommendations by experts will have a strong impact on the decisions of the TB.**
