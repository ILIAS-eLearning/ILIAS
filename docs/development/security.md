## Reporting Security Issues
Please make sure to understand, that treating security issues confidentially is required to keep ILIAS installations as safe as possible until the issue is fixed.

Please write an email to security@lists.ilias.de about your discovery, containing a description of the issue with the scenario in which the problem is triggered and a description of its implications. **Do not file an issue in the bugtracker!**

You will receive an answer from a member of the ILIAS security group about further steps.

## Publishing Fixes for Security Issues
We are delighted when solutions are offered together with the initial report. Please be aware, however, that our repository in GitHub is also open to the general public: commits, commit-messages and pull-requests can be viewed by anyone. It is therefore also better in this case to get in touch with security@lists.ilias.de in order to discuss further steps with us.

## Security Update Notifications
Please subscribe to our admin mailing list (ilias-admins@lists.ilias.de) to get notifications about security updates, updates in general and announcements for ILIAS server administrators.
