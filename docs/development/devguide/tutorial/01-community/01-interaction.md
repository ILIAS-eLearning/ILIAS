# Interaction Within the ILIAS Community

Being a new member in a community is exciting! You're probably wondering how the ILIAS community interacts. In this document, you'll find some insights on how we communicate. 

## English Language
Please use English for code comments and documentation to ensure accessibility to a broader audience.

## Informal "Du"
If you're communicating in German oustide of code and documentation, you might wonder how the community members address each other. It's common to use the informal "Du" within the community.

## Contributing Constructively
Community members aim to provide constructive feedback when reviewing code or participating in discussions. Please check [these guidelines](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/blob/trunk/docs/development/review.md) to learn how to write a constructive review. 

## Openness to Collaboration
The ILIAS community is inherently collaborative. Its members value openness to working with others, whether it's through code contributions, bug reporting, or sharing ideas. We encourage you to contribute to a cooperative environment by actively seeking input and feedback from others.

## Participating in Community Events
We highly encourage you to attend and participate in community meetings and events, such as the bi-weekly [Jour Fixe](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_1_1357.html), [Feature Workshops](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_grp_6768.html), or the [Development Conference](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_grp_3721.html).
