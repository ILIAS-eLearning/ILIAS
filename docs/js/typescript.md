# Typescript Guidelines

- You MAY use Typescript to generate Javascript code.
- Typescript files should be located in a subfolder `ts`. The generated Javascript files should be located in a subfolder `js` on the same level, e.g. `Services/Component/ts/component.ts` and `Services/Component/js/component.js`.
- You SHOULD use "es6" as a target for the compiler.
- A typescript.json file should be put in the main component folder, e.g. `Services/Component/typescript.json`.
