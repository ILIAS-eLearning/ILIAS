# Want to Contribute? Great!

## Who is a contributor?

In general we consider everyone who takes part in the development of ILIAS a
contributor, where the contribution could take various forms, e.g. testing,
creating feature request, writing documentation. We aim to include everyone
performing these or similar activities in our processes.

For practical reasons we need to define a contributor to be everyone who
wants to contribute commits to our repository for now. We trying to figure
out ways to also include Testers, Translators, Authors and other people
into the processes described here. If you want to contribute to said
activities please have a look [here](i_want_to_contribute_something_else_than_commits).

As a contributor you will be named in the release notes of our major relases
with your name and your organisation as we find them in our commit history
and in your profile on GitHub. If your don't want to be listed, please write
a short mail to the [Technical Board of the ILIAS society](mailto:tb@lists.ilias.de).

## How to contribute?

### Pull Request to the Repositories

Pull requests (PRs) will be assigned by the [Technical Board
(TB)](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=grp_5089&client_id=docu)
to the responsible maintainer. The TB will also help to resolve problems with
PRs and associated processes, if you require mediation please leave a mention via 
@ILIAS-eLearning/technical-board in the discussion of the PR.

Please make sure to understand that the ILIAS society has a [process for functional
feature request](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=wiki_1357_How_to_suggest_a_new_feature)
before starting to create your PR. Your PR should thus only contain bug fixes or
non-functional changes to our code base.

#### Rules for Contributors

We are happy that you want to contribute. To enable us to merge your PRs in our code
please make sure:

* that your PR has a description that tells what is changed and why - with a size
  relative to the changes
* that your PRs is minimal - prefer to make two small PRs instead of one big PR
* that you discuss huge PRs with the responsible maintainers in advance - this will
  save your time if the maintainers do not agree with your proposed change
* that you create commits of self-contained logical units with concise commit
  messages and no unnecessary whitespace - this will help reviewers to understand
  what you did
* that your code could be understood and is documented - this will help reviewers
  as well
* that your commit follows the [ILIAS coding guidelines](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto_docu_pg_202_42.html) -
  this is a bare minimun of style we want to maintain for new code
* that your are approachable for questions of reviewers

If your PR contains a bugfix please reference the number of the mantis ticket
in the title `12345 - To many spaces`, link the ticket in the description and
label the ticket with `bugfix`. You may make one PR per affected branch.

Please label non-bugfix PRs as `improvement`.

#### Rules for Maintainers assigned to PRs

As an FOSS community we should be glad that people want to contribute code to our
project as this reflects usage of our project. To show this when handling PRs, please
make sure

* that you react to every PR assigned to you by the TB within 21 days - at least
  with a thank you and a target date if your schedule is tight
* that you give at least a brief statement why you close a PR if you reject one
* that you merge the changes in the PR in other branches if required

### Want to Contribute Something else than Commits?

We are happy to get contributions that are no commits as well. There are many
other things you could contribute to ILIAS:

* **Ideas for new Features**: The development of ILIAS is driven by requirements
  from the community. Contribute your ideas via [feature requests](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=wiki_5307&client_id=docu#ilPageTocA119).
* **Bug Reports**: We do our best, but ILIAS might contain bugs we do not know
  yet. Check out how the ILIAS Community handles [bug reports](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=wiki_5307&client_id=docu#ilPageTocA115).
* **Information about Security Issues**: Check out how the ILIAS community handles
  [security issues](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto.php?target=wiki_5307&client_id=docu#ilPageTocA112).
* **Time for Testing or Testcases**: We always need people that contribute testcases
  and perform them before new releases. Please have a look [here](http://www.ilias.de/docu/goto_docu_pg_64423_4793.html).
  This part if our development is german only (sorry non-german-speakers).
