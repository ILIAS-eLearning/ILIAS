survey#:#metric_subtype_description_interval#:#Značilnost je intervalno skalirana, če izpolnjuje zgolj določene lastnosti kvantitativne značilnosti. Zlasti morajo intervali (razlike) omogočati smiselno interpretacijo. Pojem se uporablja zgolj za razlikovanje od značilnosti, katerih poudarki imajo tudi nadaljnje lastnosti. Pomembno je poudariti, da ničelna točka lestvic, ki se uporabljajo za merjenje intervalno skalirane značilnosti, ni nujno naravno število. Primeri za intervalno skalirane značilnosti so npr. leta v koledarjih ali temperatura po Celzijevi lestvici.
survey#:#metric_subtype_description_ratioabsolute#:#Kvantitativna značilnost pomeni absolutno skalirano značilnost, če se za njeno merjenje uporablja ena sama smiselna lestvica. To ima enak pomen kot dejstvo, da za značilnost pride v poštev ena sama smiselna enota, kot npr. število otrok v družini. Tudi značilnosti, katerih poudarki so bili merjeni v odstotkih, so absolutno skalirane (npr. verjetnosti).
survey#:#metric_subtype_description_rationonabsolute#:#Kvantitativna značilnost je relativno skalirana, če imajo lestvice, uporabljene za merjenje, skupno naravno ničelno točko. Razmerjem (količniki) med poudarki značilnosti relativno skalirane značilnosti se lahko dodeli smiselni pomen. Naravna ničelna točka namreč zagotavlja, da so razmerja med seboj ustreznih poudarkov, ki so bili merjeni po različnih lestvicah (tj. v drugih enotah), vedno enaki. Večina navedenih fizikalnih količin (hitrost v m/s ali km/h) je relativno skaliranih.
