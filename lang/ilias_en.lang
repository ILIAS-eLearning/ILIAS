In this case, you define for ‘Divisible by’ an integer value, which must be divisible by with the created variable. A value of 10 thus generates only integers that are divisible by 10. A value of 5 produces integers that are divisible by 5, etc. For a precision of 0, ‘Divisible by’ is a mandatory field and must contain a positive integer. The default value is 1 for any integers.
