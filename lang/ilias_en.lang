assessment#:#intprecision#:#Divisible By
assessment#:#intprecision_info#:#‘Divisible by’ affects only the creation of variables, if the value for the precision is 0. In this case, you define for ‘Divisible by’ an integer value, which must be divisible by with the created variable. A value of 10 thus generates only integers that are divisible by 10. A value of 5 produces integers that are divisible by 5, etc. For a precision of 0, ‘Divisible by’ is a mandatory field and must contain a positive integer. The default value is 1 for any integers.

Upload a SCORM export from your authoring tool here and not an ILIAS export file. Make sure that your authoring tool has retained the IDs in the manifest file. Attention: Even popular authoring tools cannot do this. SCORM learning modules of certain authoring tools discard learner data obtained if you change the number of answer options of questions or insert new questions.
