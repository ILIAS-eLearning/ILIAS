rep#:#rep_intro1#:#In this area you can create learning and working resources for all users. All resources are organised in categories. Categories can reflect the structure of your organisation (e.g. departments), a hierarchie of disciplines, or classes of a school.
rep#:#rep_intro2#:#Three steps are needed to build an initial structure:
rep#:#rep_intro3#:#Click on the <i>%s</i> button besides the selection list on the top right.
rep#:#rep_intro4#:#In the following form, enter a title and a description, and click on <i>%s</i>.
rep#:#rep_intro5#:#By clicking on the title of the category you enter your category.
rep#:#rep_intro6#:#After that procedure you may add any learning or working resource to your category.
