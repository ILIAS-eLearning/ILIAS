Also, they cannot have 'master' in the name.<br>Currently, only MySQL is supported.</i><p><b>Warning! This cannot be undone! The client will be overwritten with the contents of the source you will select here!</b>
info_text_contact#:#Here you indicate additional client information and the contact data of the system administrator of this client. All information is stored in your database. On the next screen you may optionally register your installation at the ILIAS open source project server.
info_text_db_collation1#:#If your desired collation is not supported in the list of UTF-8 collations, you have to create your database manually too. In any case, please make sure that the character set for the database is set to utf8.
info_text_db_collation2#:#More information about MySQL collations can be found on the MySQL website.
info_text_db#:#The database does not exist or is empty. If the database does not yet exist, please check the option 'Create Database' below. ILIAS will try to create your database automatically.

info_text_ini#:#Please choose a client ID. Any letter (except umlauts) or number is allowed. The client ID must be in one word.<br />Next you enter your database connection data. Setup establishes a test connection to verify your settings and to test if the database exists. If the database does not yet exist, you may prompt Setup in the next installation step to create the database for you.
info_text_lang#:#Please choose additional languages and/or remove selected languages. The default language specified the language for new user accounts or users which haven't selected a preferred language yet.
